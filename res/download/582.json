We can see the NIC ISR runs on CPU4.\r\n\r\nBut on my newly installed `Fedora 26`, the top doesn&#39;t show such an entry. The kernel version for `Fedora 26` is `4.11.8-300`. On CentOS7 with kernel 3.10, I still cannot see this information.\r\n\r\nHow can I find the kernel threads for ISRs and what are the names for ISR threads?

            "title": "What are the names of the kernel threads that represent ISR top-half and bottom-half?",
            "body": "<p>Using google, I know that the linux kernel interrupt handling thread is divided into two parts, the top-half thread and the bottom-half thread.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see on which CPU these two kernel threads reside. </p>\n\n<p>I use top command on <code>Fedora 19</code> to find the <code>interrupt service routine (ISR)</code>. Taking NIC ISR as example, I can see the following in the top results</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"627 root -51 0 0 0 0 S 0.000 0.000 0:00.35 irq/76-em1 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>em1</code> is the name of the <code>NIC</code>, and its interrupt number is 76 (/proc/interrupts has the information for interrupts). We can see the NIC ISR runs on CPU4.</p>\n\n<p>But on my newly installed <code>Fedora 26</code>, the top doesn't show such an entry. The kernel version for <code>Fedora 26</code> is <code>4.11.8-300</code>. On CentOS7 with kernel 3.10, I still cannot see this information.</p>\n\n<p>How can I find the kernel threads for ISRs and what are the names for ISR threads? Is this caused by linux kernel version?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"
