When user clicks on add field in section 1 (Plus MDL button), a text field should get added under Section 1.\n2. And viceversa for section 2 </p>\n\n<p>I've been trying since 3 days and unable to achieve, please assist.\n<code>enter code here</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"A front-end template that helps you build fast, modern mobile web apps.\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Material Design Lite&lt;/title&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Add to homescreen for Chrome on Android --&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"192x192\" href=\"images/android-desktop.png\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Add to homescreen for Safari on iOS --&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-title\" content=\"Material Design Lite\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href=\"images/ios-desktop.png\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Tile icon for Win8 (144x144 + tile color) --&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"msapplication-TileImage\" content=\"images/touch/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"msapplication-TileColor\" content=\"#3372DF\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"images/favicon.png\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:regular,bold,italic,thin,light,bolditalic,black,medium&amp;amp;lang=en\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://code.getmdl.io/1.3.0/material.teal-red.min.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"stylespost.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles1.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"bower_components/ckeditor/ckeditor.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/code.getmdl.io/1.0.2/material.blue-indigo.min.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Robot &lt;!--css --&gt;\n&lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\n\n\n/*____________________________________*/\n.mrg{\n        margin-top: -11.4%;\n    margin-left: 94%;\n    height: 25px;\n    background-color: #ff5252;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    color: #fff;\n    font-size: 32px;\n  }\n\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;style&gt;\n    #view-source {\n      position: fixed;\n      display: block;\n      right: 0;\n      bottom: 0;\n      margin-right: 40px;\n      margin-bottom: 40px;\n      z-index: 900;\n    }\n   .mdl-layout__header {\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    display: -ms-flexbox;\n    display: flex;\n    -webkit-flex-direction: column;\n    -ms-flex-direction: column;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    -webkit-flex-wrap: nowrap;\n    -ms-flex-wrap: nowrap;\n    flex-wrap: nowrap;\n    -webkit-justify-content: flex-start;\n    -ms-flex-pack: start;\n    justify-content: flex-start;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    -webkit-flex-shrink: 0;\n    -ms-flex-negative: 0;\n    flex-shrink: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    border: none;\n    min-height: 64px;\n    max-height: 1000px;\n    z-index: 3;\n    background-color: rgb(63, 81, 181);\n    color: rgb(255,255,255);\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.14), 0 3px 1px -2px rgba(0,0,0,.2), 0 1px 5px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.12);\n    transition-duration: .2s;\n    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1);\n    transition-property: max-height,box-shadow;\n} \n.demo-card-wide.mdl-card {\n  width: 640px;\n  height: auto;\n\n}\n\n.mdl-card__actions {\n\n  outline: skyblue solid 5px;\n  z-index: 4;\n\n\n}\n#name {\n  display:flex;\nmargin-top: 10px;\n  justify-content: left;\n}\n\n#contact{\n  diplay: flex;\n\n}\n\n\n.mdl-button {\n// outline: red solid 5px;
