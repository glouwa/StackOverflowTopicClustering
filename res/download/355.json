So, I will have all the points that are closest to the given set of points.</p>\n\n<p>The output that I have at the moment is like this </p>\n\n<pre><code>(4516831,CompactBuffer((POI1,2632.0690038389157), (POI2,2632.0690038389157), (POI3,666.9416656643995), (POI4,1450.3241112528403)))\n(4516915,CompactBuffer((POI1,2632.0690038389157), (POI2,2632.0690038389157), (POI3,666.9416656643995), (POI4,1450.3241112528403)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code that I tried to write is this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>`\n// groupData returns output in the format RDD[(Long, (String, Double))]\nval combinedData = groupData(dataRdd, poiRdd)\n  .groupByKey()\n  .map(row =&gt; {\n    var min:Double = 9999999\n    for(value &lt;- row._2) yield\n      if (value._2 &lt; min) {\n        min = value._2\n      } else min\n  (row._1, row._2.filter(r =&gt; r._2 == min))\n  }).foreach(println)\n// output like this: (4516915,List((POI3,666.9416656643995)))`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above code works fine as per requirements but I think it is really bad, especially the last line where I am returning the output as I want. There I am filtering again.\nThere must be a better way.\nHow can I achieve this? I am sorry if the question is little vague.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"

            "body_markdown": "I connect to a remote seedbox daily to upload torrents and download files. I&#39;m able to use Winscp to download and upload torrent files to the watch folder, but I would like to be able to automate zipping (archiving) up the completed files, delete move and pause downloads, and upload magnet uri directly on the seedbox. If all of these can be done in the UI, I&#39;m assuming can also be done via API. \r\n\r\nSince I mainly use a windows client, I want to be able to directly access the seedbox using a Windows scripting language like Powershell. I was able to connect to the seedbox using a script:\r\n\r\n    $SeedboxUrl = &quot;https://&lt;server&gt;.&lt;remote&gt;.com&quot;\r\n    $Username = &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;\r\n    $Password = &quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\n    $secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force\r\n    $credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Username, $secpasswd)\r\n\r\n    $SeedboxStatus = Invoke-WebRequest &quot;$SeedboxUrl/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php&quot; -Credential $credentials -Headers $headers\r\n    If($seedboxStatus.StatusDescription -eq &#39;OK&#39;){Write-host &quot;connected&quot;}\r\n\r\nBut I have no idea what how to post/get data from that nor the Xml-Rpc Method needed. \r\n\r\nI have set up Sonarr to connect to my SeedBox and its able to upload and delete torrents. How does Sonarr and other applications do it? To connect to the seedbox, you need to specify the ruTorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php, otherwise I am unable to connect...same with Sonarr. I&#39;m assuming this is rutorrent way of remote control\r\nhttps://dediseedbox.com/wiki/knowledgebase/install-connect-sonarr-rtorrent/\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been all over the net and this is what I&#39;ve been able to come up with what documentation I could find for command reference: http://rtorrent-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd-ref.html.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be as easy as sending a post command through Invoke-RestMethod as long as the body was formatted properly in xml. The closest i got a response was this:\r\n\r\n    $requestString = &quot;&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39;?&gt;&lt;methodCall&gt;&lt;methodName&gt;system.listMethods&lt;/methodName&gt;&lt;/methodCall&gt;&quot;\r\n    $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($requestString)\r\n    $request = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($bytes)\r\n\r\n    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri &quot;$SeedboxUrl/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php&quot; -Method Post -Body $request -Credential $credentials\r\n\r\nNow if I grab that response variable I drilled down to get all the

            "body": "<p>I connect to a remote seedbox daily to upload torrents and download files. I'm able to use Winscp to download and upload torrent files to the watch folder, but I would like to be able to automate zipping (archiving) up the completed files, delete move and pause downloads, and upload magnet uri directly on the seedbox. If all of these can be done in the UI, I'm assuming can also be done via API. </p>\n\n<p>Since I mainly use a windows client, I want to be able to directly access the seedbox using a Windows scripting language like Powershell. I was able to connect to the seedbox using a script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$SeedboxUrl = \"https://&lt;server&gt;.&lt;remote&gt;.com\"\n$Username = \"&lt;username&gt;\"\n$Password = \"&lt;password&gt;\"\n\n$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force\n$credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Username, $secpasswd)\n\n$SeedboxStatus = Invoke-WebRequest \"$SeedboxUrl/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php\" -Credential $credentials -Headers $headers\nIf($seedboxStatus.StatusDescription -eq 'OK'){Write-host \"connected\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I have no idea what how to post/get data from that nor the Xml-Rpc Method needed. </p>\n\n<p>I have set up Sonarr to connect to my SeedBox and its able to upload and delete torrents. How does Sonarr and other applications do it? To connect to the seedbox, you need to specify the ruTorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php, otherwise I am unable to connect...same with Sonarr. I'm assuming this is rutorrent way of remote control\n<a href=\"https://dediseedbox.com/wiki/knowledgebase/install-connect-sonarr-rtorrent/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://dediseedbox.com/wiki/knowledgebase/install-connect-sonarr-rtorrent/</a></p>\n\n<p>I've been all over the net and this is what I've been able to come up with what documentation I could find for command reference: <a href=\"http://rtorrent-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd-ref.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://rtorrent-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd-ref.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it would be as easy as sending a post command through Invoke-RestMethod as long as the body was formatted properly in xml. The closest i got a response was this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$requestString = \"&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;&lt;methodCall&gt;&lt;methodName&gt;system.listMethods&lt;/methodName&gt;&lt;/methodCall&gt;\"\n$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($requestString)\n$request = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($bytes)\n\n$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri \"$SeedboxUrl/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php\" -Method Post -Body $request -Credential $credentials\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if I grab that response variable I drilled down to get all the commands:\n<strong>$response.methodResponse.params.param.value.array.data.value.string</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>system.listMethods\nsystem.methodExist\nsystem.methodHelp\nsystem.methodSignature\nsystem.multicall\nsystem.shutdown\nsystem.capabilities\nsystem.getCapabilities\nadd_peer\nand\nbind\nbranch\ncat\ncatch\ncheck_hash\nchoke_group.down.heuristics\nchoke_group.down.heuristics.set\nchoke_group.down.max\nchoke_group.down.max.set\nchoke_group.down.max.unlimited\nchoke_group.down.queued\nchoke_group.down.rate\nchoke_group.down.total\nchoke_group.down.unchoked\nchoke_group.general.size\nchoke_group.index_of\nchoke_group.insert\nchoke_group.list\nchoke_group.size\nchoke_group.tracker.mode\nchoke_group.tracker.mode.set\nchoke_group.up.heuristics\nchoke_group.up.heuristics.set\nchoke_group.up.max\nchoke_group.up.max.set\nchoke_group.up.max.unlimited\nchoke_group.up.queued\nchoke_group.up.rate\nchoke_group.up.total\nchoke_group.up.unchoked\nclose_low_diskspace\nclose_untied\nconnection_leech\nconnection_seed\nconvert.date\nconvert.elapsed_time\nconvert.gm_date\nconvert.gm_time\nconvert.kb\nconvert.mb\nconvert.throttle\nconvert.time\nconvert.xb\nd.accepting_seeders\nd.accepting_seeders.disable\nd.accepting_seeders.enable\nd.base_filename\nd.base_path\nd.bitfield\nd.bytes_done\nd.check_hash\nd.chunk_size\nd.chunks_hashed\nd.chunks_seen\nd.close\nd.close.directly\nd.complete\nd.completed_bytes\nd.completed_chunks\nd.connection_current\nd.connection_current.set\nd.connection_leech\nd.connection_seed\nd.create_link\nd.creation_date\nd.custom\nd.custom.set\nd.custom1\nd.custom1.set\nd.custom2\nd.custom2.set\nd.custom3\nd.custom3.set\nd.custom4\nd.custom4.set\nd.custom5\nd.custom5.set\nd.custom_throw\nd.delete_link\nd.delete_tied\nd.directory\nd.directory.set\nd.directory_base\nd.directory_base.set\nd.disconnect.seeders\nd.down.choke_heuristics\nd.down.choke_heuristics.leech\nd.down.choke_heuristics.seed\nd.down.choke_heuristics.set\nd.down.rate\nd.down.total\nd.downloads_max\nd.downloads_max.set\nd.downloads_min\nd.downloads_min.set\nd.erase\nd.free_diskspace\nd.group\nd.group.name\nd.group.set\nd.hash\nd.hashing\nd.hashing_failed\nd.hashing_failed.set\nd.ignore_commands\nd.ignore_commands.set\nd.incomplete\nd.is_active\nd.is_hash_checked\nd.is_hash_checking\nd.is_multi_file\nd.is_not_partially_done\nd.is_open\nd.is_partially_done\nd.is_pex_active\nd.is_private\nd.left_bytes\nd.load_date\nd.loaded_file\nd.local_id\nd.local_id_html\nd.max_file_size\nd.max_file_size.set\nd.max_size_pex\nd.message\nd.message.set\nd.mode\nd.multicall2\nd.name\nd.open\nd.pause\nd.peer_exchange\nd.peer_exchange.set\nd.peers_accounted\nd.peers_complete\nd.peers_connected\nd.peers_max\nd.peers_max.set\nd.peers_min\nd.peers_min.set\nd.peers_not_connected\nd.priority\nd.priority.set\nd.priority_str\nd.ratio\nd.resume\nd.save_full_session\nd.save_resume\nd.size_bytes\nd.size_chunks\nd.size_files\nd.size_pex\nd.skip.rate\nd.skip.total\nd.start\nd.state\nd.state_changed\nd.state_counter\nd.stop\nd.throttle_name\nd.throttle_name.set\nd.tied_to_file\nd.tied_to_file.set\nd.timestamp.finished\nd.timestamp.started\nd.tracker.insert\nd.tracker.send_scrape\nd.tracker_announce\nd.tracker_focus\nd.tracker_numwant\nd.tracker_numwant.set\nd.tracker_size\nd.try_close\nd.try_start\nd.try_stop\nd.up.choke_heuristics\nd.up.choke_heuristics.leech\nd.up.choke_heuristics.seed\nd.up.choke_heuristics.set\nd.up.rate\nd.up.total\nd.update_priorities\nd.uploads_max\nd.uploads_max.set\nd.uploads_min\nd.uploads_min.set\nd.views\nd.views.has\nd.views.push_back\nd.views.push_back_unique\nd.views.remove\nd.wanted_chunks\ndht\ndht.add_node\ndht.mode.set\ndht.port\ndht.port.set\ndht.statistics\ndht.throttle.name\ndht.throttle.name.set\ndht_port\ndirectory\ndirectory.default\ndirectory.default.set\ndirectory.watch.added\ndownload_list\ndownload_rate\nelapsed.greater\nelapsed.less\nencoding.add\nencoding_list\nencryption\nequal\nevent.download.closed\nevent.download.erased\nevent.download.finished\nevent.download.hash_done\nevent.download.hash_failed\nevent.download.hash_final_failed\nevent.download.hash_queued\nevent.download.hash_removed\nevent.download.inserted\nevent.download.inserted_new\nevent.download.inserted_session\nevent.download.opened\nevent.download.paused\nevent.download.resumed\nexecute\nexecute.capture\nexecute.capture_nothrow\nexecute.nothrow\nexecute.nothrow.bg\nexecute.raw\nexecute.raw.bg\nexecute.raw_nothrow\nexecute.raw_nothrow.bg\nexecute.throw\nexecute.throw.bg\nexecute2\nf.completed_chunks\nf.frozen_path\nf.is_create_queued\nf.is_created\nf.is_open\nf.is_resize_queued\nf.last_touched\nf.match_depth_next\nf.match_depth_prev\nf.multicall\nf.offset\nf.path\nf.path_components\nf.path_depth\nf.prioritize_first\nf.prioritize_first.disable\nf.prioritize_first.enable\nf.prioritize_last\nf.prioritize_last.disable\nf.prioritize_last.enable\nf.priority\nf.priority.set\nf.range_first\nf.range_second\nf.set_create_queued\nf.set_resize_queued\nf.size_bytes\nf.size
