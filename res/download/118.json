The problem states that:&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn this game there are N levels and M types of available weapons. The levels are numbered from 0 to N-1 and the weapons are numbered from 0 to M-1 . **You can clear these levels in any order.** In each level, some subset of these M weapons is required to clear this level.

The 0th level (111) requires all 3 types of weapons. The 1st level (001) requires only weapon of type 2. The 2nd level requires only weapon of type 1. If we clear the levels in the given order(0-1-2), total cost = 3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9 coins.
