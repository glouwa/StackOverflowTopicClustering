I created an entity let's call it <code>SomeEntityName</code>and I added its attributes. From there I'm creating an <code>NSManagedObject</code> in <code>Editor &gt; Create NSManagedObject Subclass...</code>. The creation works and I see the <code>SomeEntityName+CoreDataClass.swift</code> and <code>SomeEntityName+CoreDataProperties.swift</code> files but, the autocomplete is not working?</p>\n\n<p>I have restarted Xcode, cleaned, rebuilt the project and still no luck. </p>\n\n<p>I tried to change the <code>Codegen</code> to <code>Manual/None</code> from <code>Class Definition</code> in the right panel core data inspector but that gives me an error of an <code>undeclared type \"EntityName\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Is there something I am missing? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: In my other Class files, I am able to autocomplete subclass definitions like <code>Codable</code> or <code>import Foundation</code>, etc.</p>\n"

            "body_markdown": "Indexes in MongoDB should be kept at a minimum. Or so I try after reading [this][1]. ..and I also fiddled with this [nice preso][2] with some great tips.\r\n\r\nI have a question and let me devise an example:\r\n\r\n&gt; I need to store data about goods stored in locations which are indexed by catalog. \r\n\r\nI have several locations. In each location I can have many goods. Each good can either be in stock or not. Every pair is found in a given catalogs.\r\nLike: \r\n\r\n    CATALOG1: NEWYORK - BREAD - 0 // 0 is out of stock\r\n    CATALOG2: LOSANGELES - WATER - 1 // 1 is in stock\r\n\r\nOne complication: I obtain the status of these by a query which is only by catalog. Like: \r\n\r\n    getMeStatusOfCatalog(&quot;CATALOG1&quot;) -&gt; { &quot;NEWYORK - BREAD&quot; : 0 }\r\n\r\nHowever: important point, `getMeStatusOfCatalog` may just stop giving me an answer of a particular good, so If I don&#39;t see `BREAD` anymore, I still need to set to `0` the `BREAD` for that particular catalog. This means that in my &quot;write&quot; operation I need to get all the past &quot;active&quot; goods based on a catalog (below `in_catalog`).\r\n\r\nMy main business objective in my application is that **I need to display the breakdown of each location**, like:\r\n\r\n    Location 1 has: bread which is out of stock, etc\r\n    Location 2 has: water which is fine, etc\r\n\r\nif I set up my `_id` as `&quot;LOCATION:GOOD&quot;` then I can query as `/^LOCATION/` and get all the things I need[*][2]. Overall:\r\n\r\n    { \r\n      _id: &quot;LOCATION:GOOD&quot;\r\n      catalog: &quot;...&quot; \r\n      in_stock: 0|1\r\n      in_catalog: 0|1\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, I am troubled by data insertion/update based on the `getMeStatusOfCatalog`. How will I fetch all the documents which need to be updated?\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t add it to the `_id` discussed before since I won&#39;t be able to use left-anchored-regex anymore. Do I need to make `catalog` an index (combined, unique)?\r\n\r\nHow would you design this as to have both performant reads and writes?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/indexes/\r\n  [2]: https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongodb-time-series-data-part-2-analyzing-time-series-data-using-aggregation-framework",

            "body": "<p>Indexes in MongoDB should be kept at a minimum. Or so I try after reading <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/indexes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>. ..and I also fiddled with this <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongodb-time-series-data-part-2-analyzing-time-series-data-using-aggregation-framework\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nice preso</a> with some great tips.</p>\n\n<p>I have a question and let me devise an example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I need to store data about goods stored in locations which are indexed by catalog. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have several locations. In each location I can have many goods. Each good can either be in stock or not. Every pair is found in a given catalogs.\nLike: </p>\n\n<pre><code>CATALOG1: NEWYORK - BREAD - 0 // 0 is out of stock\nCATALOG2: LOSANGELES - WATER - 1 // 1 is in stock\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One complication: I obtain the status of these by a query which is only by catalog. Like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>getMeStatusOfCatalog(\"CATALOG1\") -&gt; { \"NEWYORK - BREAD\" : 0 }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However: important point, <code>getMeStatusOfCatalog</code> may just stop giving me an answer of a particular good, so If I don't see <code>BREAD</code> anymore, I still need to set to <code>0</code> the <code>BREAD</code> for that particular catalog. This means that in my \"write\" operation I need to get all the past \"active\" goods based on a catalog (below <code>in_catalog</code>).</p>\n\n<p>My main business objective in my application is that <strong>I need to display the breakdown of each location</strong>, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Location 1 has: bread which is out of stock, etc\nLocation 2 has: water which is fine, etc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>if I set up my <code>_id</code> as <code>\"LOCATION:GOOD\"</code> then I can query as <code>/^LOCATION/</code> and get all the things I need<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongodb-time-series-data-part-2-analyzing-time-series-data-using-aggregation-framework\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">*</a>. Overall:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \n  _id: \"LOCATION:GOOD\"\n  catalog: \"...\" \n  in_stock: 0|1\n  in_catalog: 0|1\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I am troubled by data insertion/update based on the <code>getMeStatusOfCatalog</code>. How will I fetch all the documents which need to be updated?</p>\n\n<p>I can't add it to the <code>_id</code> discussed before since I won't be able to use left-anchored-regex anymore. Do I need to make <code>catalog</code> an index (combined, unique)?</p>\n\n<p>How would you design this as to have both performant reads and writes?</p>\n"
