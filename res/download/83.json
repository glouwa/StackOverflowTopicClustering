I have downloaded an example project from GITHUB two days ago and it was working properly. Yesterday I updated Vue and now I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Vue warn]: You are using the runtime-only build of Vue where the template option is not available. Either pre-compile the templates into render functions or use the compiler-included build.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are my file at the moment :\nMain.js</p>\n\n<pre><code>import { Template } from 'meteor/templating';\nimport { Session } from 'meteor/session';\n\nimport './main.html';\n\nSession.setDefault(\"counter\", 0);\n\n\nTemplate.hello.helpers({\n  counter() {\n    return Session.get(\"counter\");\n  },\n});\n\nTemplate.hello.events({\n  'click button'(event, instance) {\n    // increment the counter when button is clicked\n    Session.set(\"counter\", Session.get(\"counter\")+1);\n  },\n});\n\nimport {Vue} from 'meteor/akryum:vue';\nimport Widget from '/imports/ui/Widget.vue';\n\nTemplate.vue_demo.rendered = function() {\n  var vm = new Vue({\n    el: '#vue-demo',\n    template: '&lt;div&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;/widget&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',\n    components: {\n      Widget\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Main.html</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;vue-blaze&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Meteor!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n  {{&gt; hello}}\n  {{&gt; vue_demo}}\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;template name=\"hello\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You've pressed the button {{counter}} times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;template name=\"vue_demo\"&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"vue-demo\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Widget.vue</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"widget\"&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;Hello {{name}}!&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input v-model=\"name\" placeholder=\"Enter your name\" /&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      You've pressed the button {{counter}} times (inside vue component).\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  import {Session} from 'meteor/session';\n\n  export default {\n    data() {\n      return {\n        name: 'world',\n        counter: 0\n      }\n    },\n    meteor: {\n      data: {\n        counter() {\n          return Session.get(\"counter\");\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;style scoped&gt;\n.widget {\n  background: #a0ddc4;\n  padding: 12px;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  width: 300px;\n  border-bottom: solid 1px #40b883;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have read that the error has something to do with needing the compiler setup in order to render the template and to do this I have to create an alias in my 'webpack.config' which I did:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var webpack = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './script.js',\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'compiled.js'\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['', '.js'],\n    alias: {\n      'vue$': 'vue/dist/vue.esm.js' // 'vue/dist/vue.common.js' for webpack 1\n    }\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am new to both Meteor and Vue so probably the answer is very easy but I don't know what to do so I would appreciate some help! Thanks!</p>\n"
