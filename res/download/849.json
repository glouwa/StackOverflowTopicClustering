            "body_markdown": "My goal is to create Anki flashcards for learning R, using R. I discovered a neat package called `r2anki` which seems to do the trick. Based on their documentation, you are supposed to run the command `r2anki::r2anki(init = TRUE)` in order to &quot;copy a few Anki-cards with the r2anki-styling to Anki, so that the R Markdown-output can be rendered properly.&quot; However, when I run the code I get the following error:\r\n  \r\n\r\n    &gt;   Import not fully tested for OSX. \r\n    &gt;   sh: anki: command not found\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately, no Anki card was copied with the r2anki-styling. As a result, my styling is a bit off and my Anki card tags are not being picked up properly. Has anyone else encountered this error message before? To reproduce the issue, download and load the `r2anki` package, open a new RMD file using RStudio, select &quot;from template&quot; and then &quot;r2anki-Notebook&quot; and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind responses\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nHere is the RMD code to reproduce the error:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    title: &quot;r2anki-Notebook: How to use r2anki&quot;\r\n    output:\r\n      html_document:\r\n        theme: &quot;flatly&quot;\r\n        highlight: &quot;pygments&quot;\r\n        self_contained: false  # false, so that images can be exported to anki as well\r\n        toc: true\r\n        toc_depth: 4\r\n        toc_float: true\r\n    editor_options: \r\n      chunk_output_type: console\r\n    ---\r\n    ```{r, echo = FALSE}\r\n    knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = &quot;#&gt;&quot;, collapse = TRUE)\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!-- #globaltags:  add, global, tags here--&gt;\r\n    \r\n    # Working with r2anki\r\n    This document demonstrates how you may use the r2anki-package. \r\n    \r\n    To do this, a few Anki-cards are defined below, which you can import into Anki.

It allows you to easily create Anki-cards with R Markdown in R, which you can than export to Anki. There you can study and rehearse the cards to effectively expand your R-vocabulary.\r\n    &lt;!-- end backside --&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ******************\r\n    #### What is Spaced Repitition?\r\n    &lt;!-- #tags:  --&gt;\r\n    **Whats the idea behind it and why is it useful?**\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!-- start backside --&gt;\r\n    Spaced Repition is a *learning technique*, that helps you to learn and remember new knowledge effectively. It accounts for the fact, that well-know material needs to be rehearsed much less often than new material.
