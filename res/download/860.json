            "body_markdown": "I&#39;m writing Web API in ASP NET Core and I want to consume it from single page applications (e.g. using Angular, Vue, React), native desktop applications and mobile applications. \r\n\r\nI stumbled across concept called *&quot;HATEOAS&quot;* and I learnt that the API I&#39;m building isn&#39;t really RESTful and I wrongly named it RESTful (https://devblast.com/b/calling-your-web-api-restful-youre-doing-it-wrong). \r\n\r\nAnd it seems like most of the people use this term badly (Roy T. Fielding  - man behind REST idea about his annoyance: http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven)\r\n\r\nFrom what I learnt the idea behind HATEOAS is thinking of your application as you think of websites, that means it exposes links to resources (like `&lt;a href.../&gt;` in HTML) so you don&#39;t have to hardcode the links/endpoints in your client code and your client code won&#39;t break if you change some endpoint (?).\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that it makes your API discoverable without any documentation, i.e. API describes itself (like meta API)\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the existing &quot;REST&quot; clients for C# for example: \r\n\r\n - [RestSharp][1]\r\n - [RestEase][2]\r\n\r\nThey have &quot;REST&quot; in their name but none of them dig into the concept of HATEOAS. So why the heck are they named &quot;Rest clients&quot;?\r\n\r\nHow HATEOAS is supposed to be used on the client-side? To my surprise there isn&#39;t much about it on the internet, there&#39;s a lot about how to implement HATEOAS on the server, but there isn&#39;t much how it&#39;s supposed to work on the client. That most often should provide navigation logic.\r\n\r\nBesides of that all, there are many API client generators (parsing OpenAPI specification) like [AutoRest][3] (nothing about hyperlinks and HATEOAS, to my surprise), or [NSwag][4]\r\n\r\nI was googling for few hours to learn about HATEOAS, but most often people talk about it without describing how to use it (there are almost none client libraries supporting it). \r\n\r\nThere are many standards for it like [HAL][5], [Ion][6] etc. But there are almost none rest client libraries implementing those standards. There&#39;s also [json:api][7]. All these standards are very similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo my question is: \r\n\r\n - Is HATEOAS applicable for applications like SPAs, mobile and desktop clients?\r\n\r\n - What&#39;s the real use case for HATEOAS, if I can as well hardcode my endpoints, or generate new API client from OpenAPI (Swagger) specification as it changes?\r\n\r\n - Is it even worth to bother with it?\r\n\r\nThere are almost none practical examples of interacting with HATEOAS or Hypermedia APIs, or am I missing something here and they&#39;re not supposed to be used by my client code? \r\n\r\nTo me it seems like implementing it on both client and the server is a lot of boilerplate code, so why aren&#39;t there many libraries supporting it out of the box (using one of the standard). It seems like json:api has many implementations http://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries-net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp &quot;RestSharp&quot;\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/canton7/RestEase &quot;RestEase&quot;\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/Azure/autorest &quot;AutoRest&quot;\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag &quot;NSwag&quot;\r\n  [5]: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\r\n  [6]: http://ionwg.org/\r\n  [7]: http://jsonapi.org/",

            "title": "Consuming HATEOAS API from native clients, Is REST really REST?",
            "body": "<p>I'm writing Web API in ASP NET Core and I want to consume it from single page applications (e.g. using Angular, Vue, React), native desktop applications and mobile applications. </p>\n\n<p>I stumbled across concept called <em>\"HATEOAS\"</em> and I learnt that the API I'm building isn't really RESTful and I wrongly named it RESTful (<a href=\"https://devblast.com/b/calling-your-web-api-restful-youre-doing-it-wrong\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://devblast.com/b/calling-your-web-api-restful-youre-doing-it-wrong</a>). </p>\n\n<p>And it seems like most of the people use this term badly (Roy T. Fielding  - man behind REST idea about his annoyance: <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven</a>)</p>\n\n<p>From what I learnt the idea behind HATEOAS is thinking of your application as you think of websites, that means it exposes links to resources (like <code>&lt;a href.../&gt;</code> in HTML) so you don't have to hardcode the links/endpoints in your client code and your client code won't break if you change some endpoint (?).</p>\n\n<p>Another thing is that it makes your API discoverable without any documentation, i.e. API describes itself (like meta API)</p>\n\n<p>When I look at the existing \"REST\" clients for C# for example: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"RestSharp\">RestSharp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/canton7/RestEase\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"RestEase\">RestEase</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They have \"REST\" in their name but none of them dig into the concept of HATEOAS. So why the heck are they named \"Rest clients\"?</p>\n\n<p>How HATEOAS is supposed to be used on the client-side? To my surprise there isn't much about it on the internet, there's a lot about how to implement HATEOAS on the server, but there isn't much how it's supposed to work on the client. That most often should provide navigation logic.</p>\n\n<p>Besides of that all, there are many API client generators (parsing OpenAPI specification) like <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/autorest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"AutoRest\">AutoRest</a> (nothing about hyperlinks and HATEOAS, to my surprise), or <a href=\"https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"NSwag\">NSwag</a></p>\n\n<p>I was googling for few hours to learn about HATEOAS, but most often people talk about it without describing how to use it (there are almost none client libraries supporting it). </p>\n\n<p>There are many standards for it like <a href=\"http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HAL</a>, <a href=\"http://ionwg.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ion</a> etc. But there are almost none rest client libraries implementing those standards. There's also <a href=\"http://jsonapi.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">json:api</a>. All these standards are very similar.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is HATEOAS applicable for applications like SPAs, mobile and desktop clients?</p></li>\n<li><p>What's the real use case for HATEOAS, if I can as well hardcode my endpoints, or generate new API client from OpenAPI (Swagger) specification as it changes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is it even worth to bother with it?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are almost none practical examples of interacting with HATEOAS or Hypermedia APIs, or am I missing something here and they're not supposed to be used by my client code? </p>\n\n<p>To me it seems like implementing it on both client and the server is a lot of boilerplate code, so why aren't there many libraries supporting it out of the box (using one of the standard). It seems like json:api has many implementations <a href=\"http://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries-net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries-net</a></p>\n"

I did about 20 tests in a row and sometimes the new link is added fine, sometimes it is not, and sometimes it is added for a second and then disappears.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried putting an alert in the code before this line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var temp = document.getElementById(\"Sites_BrandBar\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The delay is execution makes it work so clearly it is a timing thing. I assume that sometimes the suite bar is not ready when the code runs. I added a timeout as a test:</p>\n\n<pre><code>setTimeout(function(){\n    var temp = document.getElementById(\"Sites_BrandBar\");\n    temp.parentElement.appendChild(link);\n}, 500);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This fixes the issue but I don't like the idea of using a timeout every time the page runs.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas on how to delay the code execution until the suite bar is ready?</p>\n"
