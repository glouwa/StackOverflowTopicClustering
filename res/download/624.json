Ok, frankly that's part of why I'm here. </p>\n\n<h2>Also Linux was not my key to success</h2>\n\n<p>No, no it wasn't. I mentioned that Linux box earlier. And I totally tried to configure the VSTS build to deploy there. And it did deploy there \"successfully\". I can get 503s or 404s from that server but I don't get anything else. </p>\n\n<h2>What I would like</h2>\n\n<p>Some direction. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I've missed a setting in a configuration file that would be like an application setting named \"LetAngularRespectRoutesInTheBrowserWhenNotOnLocalhost\" </p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I missed something in that simple index.js file</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Linux actually is the key and I need to figure out what's wrong with that build. </p>\n\n<h2>Lastly</h2>\n\n<p>Thank you </p>\n"
