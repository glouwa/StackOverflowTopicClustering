I've successfully installed pip and have used pip to install a bunch of packages (including numpy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits and so on). But when I install the basemap and run the <code>from mpl_toolkits.basemap install Basemap</code>, an error occurs saying that <code>there is no module named \"mpl_toolkits.basemap</code>.\nI go to the document of basemap and it says that <code>GEOS</code> of 3.1.1 is required. And when I run the <code>pip install geos</code>, what I get is only <code>geos-0.2.1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuv9Q.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuv9Q.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>(so inconvenient to upload pictures)</p>\n\n<p>Is their any alternatives to download GEOS for the basemap installation? I know there's a way for Linux to install, but it does not seem to work on Windows.</p>\n"
