I wish to send email alerts when the following events happen:\r\n\r\n - When an Article is created\r\n - When an Article is updated\r\n - When an Article is deleted\r\n\r\n[The docs][1] say I can use Model Events and register them within the `boot()` function of `App\\Providers\\EventServiceProvider`.\r\n\r\nBut this is confusing me because...\r\n\r\n - What happens when I add further models like `Comment` or `Author` that need full sets of all their own Model Events? Will the single `boot()` function of `EventServiceProvider` just be absolutely huge?\r\n - What is the purpose of [Laravel&#39;s &#39;other&#39; Events][2]? Why would I ever need to use them if realistically my events will only respond to Model CRUD actions?\r\n\r\nI am a beginner at Laravel, having come from CodeIgniter, so trying to wrap my head around the proper Laravel way of doing things.

            "body": "<p>So the way I see it is that a good Laravel application should be very model- and event-driven.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Model called <code>Article</code>. I wish to send email alerts when the following events happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When an Article is created</li>\n<li>When an Article is updated</li>\n<li>When an Article is deleted</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent#model-events\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The docs</a> say I can use Model Events and register them within the <code>boot()</code> function of <code>App\\Providers\\EventServiceProvider</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But this is confusing me because...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What happens when I add further models like <code>Comment</code> or <code>Author</code> that need full sets of all their own Model Events? Will the single <code>boot()</code> function of <code>EventServiceProvider</code> just be absolutely huge?</li>\n<li>What is the purpose of <a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/events\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laravel's 'other' Events</a>? Why would I ever need to use them if realistically my events will only respond to Model CRUD actions?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am a beginner at Laravel, having come from CodeIgniter, so trying to wrap my head around the proper Laravel way of doing things. Thanks for your advice!</p>\n"

But I only want a simple error string to be displayed `alertContainer` without refreshing the whole page. I can, of course, add some `Ajax` script to the bottom of the `html` page but I&#39;m not sure how to make that work.",

            "body": "<p>So I have a simple login page like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;form class=\"form-container\" method=\"post\" action=\"/login\"&gt;\n\n      &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"username\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Username&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter Username\" name=\"username\" required&gt;\n\n        &lt;label for=\"password\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Password&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Enter Password\" name=\"password\" required&gt;\n\n        &lt;div id=\"alertContainer\" class=\"alert-container\"&gt;{{data}}&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;label&gt;\n          &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"checked\" name=\"remember\"&gt; Remember me\n        &lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>note that the <code>alertContainer</code> is a div reserved to display any errors. For example, if the username is not found, I want to display <code>\"Username not found\"</code> here, Hence the <code>handlebars</code> syntax <code>{{data}}</code></p>\n\n<p>My backend <code>POST</code> request using express looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.post('/login', function(req, res) {\n    var user = //find user in database;\n\n    if(!user) {\n        var data = \"Username not found\";\n        // somehow get to page to display data\n    }\n\n    // do other things\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is I only know how to re-render the page to pass in data. But I only want a simple error string to be displayed <code>alertContainer</code> without refreshing the whole page. I can, of course, add some <code>Ajax</code> script to the bottom of the <code>html</code> page but I'm not sure how to make that work.</p>\n"
