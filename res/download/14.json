I&#39;ve searched around and found similar questions, but nothing that&#39;ll answer exactly what I want, so hopefully I&#39;m not duplicating a common question.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i have a DataFrame with columns for `patient_id` and `procedure_id` (and others, but these are the relevant ones. For example:\r\n\r\n       patient_id  procedure_id\r\n    0      000001         74177\r\n    1      000001         52334\r\n    2      000001         67182\r\n    3      000002         52334\r\n    4      000003         20134\r\n    5      000003         12907\r\n    6      000004         67182\r\n    etc\r\n\r\nI want to plot the distribution in which the x axis is the number of procedures a patient has had performed, and the y axis is the number of patients that have had said number of procedures performed.
