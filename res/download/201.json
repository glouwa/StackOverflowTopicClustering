We need to show that if (i, j) is not in any minimum cut then there is some maximum ﬂow f∗ with f_ij* &lt; u_ij . Now if (i, j) is not in any minimum cut then every cut it is in has capacity at least k + 1. So if we reduce the capacity of (i, j) by one, that is u_ij’ = u_ij − 1, then the minimum cut in the new graph G’ is still equal to k. But then G’ has a maximum ﬂow f’ of value k and f_ij’ ≤ u_ij’ &lt; u_ij . Now f’ is clearly a maximum ﬂow in the original graph G that does not use all of the capacity of (i, j).\r\n\r\n",

We need to show that if (i, j) is not in any minimum cut then there is some maximum ﬂow f∗ with f_ij* &lt; u_ij . Now if (i, j) is not in any minimum cut then every cut it is in has capacity at least k + 1. So if we reduce the capacity of (i, j) by one, that is u_ij’ = u_ij − 1, then the minimum cut in the new graph G’ is still equal to k. But then G’ has a maximum ﬂow f’ of value k and f_ij’ ≤ u_ij’ &lt; u_ij . Now f’ is clearly a maximum ﬂow in the original graph G that does not use all of the capacity of (i, j).</p>\n"

If it's empty, return null. If it's not, we're certain there's an element in there that can be returned by .max() and .get()</p>\n\n<p>I don't feel comfortable refactoring this method just because Sonarlint tells me to, I'd rather know why I'm getting this warning</p>\n"
