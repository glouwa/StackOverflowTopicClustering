            "body": "<p>I am using a 328P (Running on the internal 8mhz) to generate a Square wave at around 111K hz or 120K hz with and adjustable duty cycle. </p>\n\n<p>I'm fairly new to doing this level of hardware manipulation so please excuse my ignorance, I spent 3 days looking online and in the datasheet but I'm afraid my understanding of what the acronyms and abbreviations mean is still too limited.</p>\n\n<p>So far I have come up with the following code after doing the research online and in the datasheet. But I feel like I'm missing something, What register manipulates frequency and what register manipulates duty cycle in (Datasheet 20.12.5) Phase and Frequency Correct PWM Mode?</p>\n\n<pre><code>void setup(){\n    DDRB |= (1 &lt;&lt; DDB1); //Set PB1 as output\n    OCR1A = (Unsure of what TOP should be here);\n    TCCR1A = (1 &lt;&lt; WGM10) | (1 &lt;&lt; COM1B0) | (1 &lt;&lt; COM1A0);\n    TCCR1B = (1 &lt;&lt; CS10) | (1 &lt;&lt; WGM13);\n}\nvoid loop(){\n    //manipulate duty cycle with other code here\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What am I missing or what should I be doing differently here?\nI tried to use the online AVR Timer Calc to help me get clock ticks needed for that frequency. It says a total of 72 Timer ticks with no prescaler and 16 bit timer would yield a 111Khz (approximate) Square wave. Jumping to 73 or 71 jumps the frequency too much out of the desired range. is there any way to get that closer on an AVR?</p>\n"

I&#39;m not sure what else I can do, as Guzzle&#39;s documentation isn&#39;t very clear on the syntax differences between 5 and 6. Then the Drupal and Laravel crowds tend to have unrelated issues.\r\n\r\nThis SO post seemed similar (minus the hard-coded port number and Guzzle v.5) but doesn&#39;t mention anything I haven&#39;t tried: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29017526/php-guzzle-5-cannot-handle-url-with-port-number-in-it .\r\n\r\nThis question is also of interest, but based on other apps that interact with App 1, it does allow other apps to consume certain API endpoints: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48921838/curl-error-7-failed-to-connect-to-maps-googleapis-com-port-443\r\n\r\nAll I can think of at this point is maybe it&#39;s an nginx configuration issue? A push in the right direction is all I need to get moving forward and get the rest of the endpoints I need to consume, being consumed. \r\n\r\nThanks for any guidance!",

GuzzleHttp\\Promise\\RejectedPromise-&gt;wait() /var/www/app/vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Client.php:131\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how I'm currently implementing the client (including some of the code I've added in my attempts to remedy this):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nnamespace Controllers\\Api;\n\nuse \\GuzzleHttp\\Client;\n// use \\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Uri;\n\ndefine('URL', 'https://app-one.local/api/');\n\nclass Dashboard extends ApiController \n{\n    private $http;\n\n    public function __construct($container)\n    {\n        // We're using guzzle for our requests to help keep opportunity\n        // for cURL errors to a minimum\n        $this-&gt;http = new Client([\n            'base_uri'          =&gt; URL,\n            'timeout'           =&gt; 30.0,\n            'allow_redirects'   =&gt; true,\n            'verify'            =&gt; false,\n            'curl'              =&gt; [\n                 CURLOPT_VERIFYPEER =&gt; false\n            ],\n            'headers'           =&gt; [\n                'User-Agent'        =&gt; 'curl/7.38.0',\n            ],\n        ]);\n\n        $response = $this-&gt;http-&gt;get('member/sales/hasalestest');\n        var_dump($response);\n        exit;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, I can access this endpoint via browser just fine, and can access it directly with cURL in the terminal so long I use the <code>-k</code> flag for \"insecure\". I'm not sure what else I can do, as Guzzle's documentation isn't very clear on the syntax differences between 5 and 6. Then the Drupal and Laravel crowds tend to have unrelated issues.</p>\n\n<p>This SO post seemed similar (minus the hard-coded port number and Guzzle v.5) but doesn't mention anything I haven't tried: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29017526/php-guzzle-5-cannot-handle-url-with-port-number-in-it\">PHP Guzzle 5: Cannot handle URL with PORT number in it</a> .</p>\n\n<p>This question is also of interest, but based on other apps that interact with App 1, it does allow other apps to consume certain API endpoints: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48921838/curl-error-7-failed-to-connect-to-maps-googleapis-com-port-443\">cURL error 7: Failed to connect to maps.googleapis.com port 443</a></p>\n\n<p>All I can think of at this point is maybe it's an nginx configuration issue? A push in the right direction is all I need to get moving forward and get the rest of the endpoints I need to consume, being consumed. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any guidance!</p>\n"
