            "body": "<p>In my Rails 4 app, I have this query to a Postgres <strong>9.4</strong> database:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@chosen_opportunity = Opportunity.find_by_sql(\n  \" UPDATE \\\"opportunities\\\" s\n    SET opportunity_available = false\n    FROM (\n          SELECT \\\"opportunities\\\".*\n          FROM   \\\"opportunities\\\"\n          WHERE  ( deal_id = #{@deal.id}\n          AND    opportunity_available = true \n          AND    pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(id) )\n          LIMIT  1\n          FOR    UPDATE\n          ) sub\n    WHERE       s.id = sub.id\n    RETURNING   sub.prize_id, sub.id\"\n) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Very much inspired by <a href=\"https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/69497\">this related answer on dba.SE</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I just want my query to find and update the first (randomly, with <code>LIMIT</code>) row where <code>available = true</code> and update it to <code>available = false</code>, and I need to lock the row while doing this, but without making new requests waiting for the release of the previous lock as there are many <strong>concurrent calls</strong> that will use this query.</p>\n\n<p>But I also saw the <code>NOWAIT</code> option to <code>FOR UPDATE</code>. I'm not sure I understand the difference between using <code>pg_try_advisory_xact_lock()</code> and the <code>NOWAIT</code> option, they seem to me to achieve the same goal: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>NOWAIT</code>'s goal</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To prevent the operation from waiting for other transactions to commit, use the <code>NOWAIT</code> option.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/69497\"><code>pg_try_advisory_xact_lock</code>'s goal</a><br>\nis not to wait for the previous transaction to release the lock and still be able to do another transaction and only operate the next select for update the 'not yet locked' rows.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which one is better suited to my need?</p>\n"

On the front-end of the site is a SilverStripe form that is used to update some fields for a Project. New files and images can also be uploaded in the front-end form. </p>\n\n<p>I am using a module called SilverStripe Dropzone Master (<a href=\"https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-dropzone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-dropzone</a>) to create an upload field on the front-end form. I managed to get it working so that it saves all uploads to the correct folder in the assets directory (each Project has a folder for uploaded files, and the setup is assets/projects/[project id]/files/). However I'm not sure how to attach/associate these uploaded files to the Project. It's good they are being uploaded to the right folder but if the files aren't associated with a project, then that's not good.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for the front-end form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function UpdateMyProjectProfileForm()\n{\n    $fieldsArr = array();\n    $member = Member::currentUser();\n\n    if (!$member) {\n        return \"&lt;div class='text-danger'&gt;Error: must be logged in to view this page.&lt;/div&gt;\";\n    }\n    $request = $this-&gt;getRequest();\n    $projectName = $request-&gt;param('ProjectName');\n    $projectNameID = explode(\"-\", $projectName);\n\n    $projectNameID = $projectNameID[0];\n\n    if ($member-&gt;inGroup('project-lead')) {\n        $project = Project::get()\n            -&gt;filter(\n                array(\n                    \"ProjectLeadID\" =&gt; $member-&gt;ID,\n                    \"ID\" =&gt; $projectNameID\n                )\n            )\n            -&gt;first();\n        $name = ReadonlyField::create('Name', 'Name of Project', $project-&gt;Name);\n        $firstName = ReadonlyField::create('FirstName', 'First Name of Project Manager', $project-&gt;FirstName);\n        $lastName = ReadonlyField::create('LastName', 'Last Name of Project Manager', $project-&gt;LastName);\n        $phone = ReadonlyField::create('Phone', \"Phone Number\", $project-&gt;Phone);\n        $emailAddress = ReadonlyField::create('Email', \"Manager Email\", $project-&gt;Email);\n        $notes = TextareaField::create('Notes', 'Notes', $project-&gt;Notes);\n        $projectSummary = TextareaField::create('ProjectSummary', \"Project Summary\", $project-&gt;ProjectSummary);\n        $imageUploader = FileAttachmentField::create('MyFile', 'Upload a file')\n            -&gt;setView('grid')\n            -&gt;setMultiple(true)\n            -&gt;setFolderName(\"projects/\".$project-&gt;ID.'/expenses'); //THIS WORKS - Stores the file(s) uploaded to the proper directory\n\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $name);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $firstName);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $lastName);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $phone);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $emailAddress);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $notes);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $projectSummary);\n        array_push($fieldsArr, $imageUploader);\n        $fields = new FieldList($fieldsArr);\n\n        $updateButton = FormAction::create('update', 'Update')\n            -&gt;addExtraClass(\"btn btn-default commonBtn\");\n\n        $actions = new FieldList($updateButton);\n        $required = new RequiredFields(\n            array('Name', 'Notes', 'ProjectSummary')\n        );\n\n        $form = new Form($this, $projectName .
