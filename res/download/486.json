Its currently not finish but midway i decided to export it and see how it runs outside of codepen. When i exported it runs perfect on google chrome on my local pc, however i sent the html exported file to two separate pcs and when the file was opened the web page was nothing like how it was opening on my pc. The css dont seem to be working.Back ground images are missing, images that had css classes applied to them seemed to be not effective, fonts seemed to be overridden by default fonts</p>\n\n<p>here is a link to my code pen:\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/Lerts/pen/RMeLPO\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter link description here</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Black+Han+Sans\" rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Gugi\" rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n&lt;body class=\"boDy\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"myDiv\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"bg\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;h1 class=\"myfont2 text-center\"&gt; &lt;span style=\"color:purple\"&gt;T.E.Q&lt;/span&gt; \n    &lt;span style=\"color:green\"&gt;MOLECULE&lt;/span&gt; MEDIA&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;nav id=\"nav-example\" class=\"navbar navbar-inverse bg-dark affix sticky\" data-target-offset=\"18\"&gt;  \n    &lt;a class=\"navbar-brand myfont\" href=\"#\"&gt;TEQ Molecule&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"&gt;\n        &lt;li class=\"nav-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#Portfolio\"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li class=\"nav-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;a class=\"nav-link \" href=\"#About\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li class=\"nav-item dropdown\"&gt;\n            &lt;a class=\"nav-link dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\"&gt;Dropdown&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"dropdown-menu\"&gt;\n                &lt;a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#Contact\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt; \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"bckground\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"bb1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"#scroller\" data-spy=\"scroll\" data-target=\"#nav-example\" data-offset=\"10\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"myfont2\" id=\"About\" style=\"left:20px\"&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n        &lt;h3&gt;ABOUT T.E.Q&lt;/h3&gt; \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img class=\"smallerImage\"style=\"margin-left:20px\"src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/860/40814758834_31a56037fb_b.jpg\" alt=\"about TEQ\"&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"divider\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"Portfolio\" class=\"myfont2\"&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;PORTFOLIO&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"col-md-4\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt; &lt;img class=\"thumbnail imgCenter\" src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/842/41527921141_e5c1bdbd42_b.jpg\" alt=\"graphic arts\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;p class=\"text-center myfont\"&gt; GRAPHIC DESIGN&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"col-md-4\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt; &lt;img class=\"thumbnail imgCenter\"  src=\"https://f9tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dev-1.jpg\" alt=\"web deveopment\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;p class=\"text-center myfont\"&gt; WEB DEVELOPMENT&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"col-md-4\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"thumbnail imgCenter\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://scontent.fbgi2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/25299007_1255958357881913_5312854462633629399_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=0c924733b42ea92b9916ab8576192094&amp;oe=5B59AE75\" alt=\"digital marketing\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;p class=\"text-center myfont\"&gt;DIGITAL MARKETING&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"divider2\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"

When I tried building it against my simple HelloWorld.c program statically, it threw error of not finding symbols in the linking stage: <code>close</code>, <code>sbrk</code>, <code>read</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I also followed the <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/newlib/README\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">instruction</a> to build newlib natively with a target same as host, but now in a x86 (32-bit) Linux. I first tried with 1.8.0 version and then it threw the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gcc -g -O2  -O2 -DMISSING_SYSCALL_NAMES -fno-builtin -I/home/ubuntu14-32/newlib/build/newlib/./targ-include -I/home/ubuntu14-32/newlib/newlib-1.8.0/newlib/./libc/include -c ../../../../newlib-1.8.0/newlib/libc/signal/signal.c\n../../../../newlib-1.8.0/newlib/libc/signal/signal.c: In function ‘_raise_r’:\n../../../../newlib-1.8.0/newlib/libc/signal/signal.c:183:5: error: pointers are not permitted as case values\n     case SIG_DFL:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried with 2.2.0 version. It threw the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error: in `/home/ubuntu14-32/newlib/build/i686-pc-linux-gnu/64/newlib':\nconfigure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.\nIf you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If in <code>../&lt;source&gt;/configure --target=i686-linux-gnu</code> is given, then after compiling some files, it threw following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>note: previous declaration of ‘__loff_t’ was here\n __extension__ typedef long long int __loff_t;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Has anyone built newlib in the same machine as the target? It is supposed to be most straightforward. I don't know why this is causing so much problem.</p>\n"
