I want the table to behave like radio buttons, in groups of 3&#39;s - so that for each row, if I click a cell in that row, that cell will do something (for now I&#39;m just adding a css class called &#39;chosen&#39; to it), and for the other cells in that row, the class will be removed. \r\n\r\nSo the algorithm I thought of goes like this:\r\n\r\n    1. Get an object containing all rows of the table.\r\n    2. Using a nested for loop, add an event listener to each cell of the table.\r\n    3. In the event function, remove the &#39;choses&#39; class from all cells of the row, using a for loop.\r\n    4. add the &#39;chosen&#39; class to the clicked cell.\r\n\r\nand the code itself:\r\n\r\n    var rows = document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;rows&quot;);\r\n\r\n    for (var i=0; i &lt; rows.length; i++)\r\n    {\r\n      for (var j=0; j &lt; rows[i].cells.length; j++)\r\n      {\r\n        rows[i].cells[j].addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n          for (var k = 0; k &lt; rows[i].cells.length; k++) {\r\n            rows[i].cells[k].classList.remove(&#39;chosen&#39;);\r\n          }\r\n          this.classList.add(&#39;chosen&#39;);\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I&#39;m completely new to JS, clearly I&#39;m missing something because I&#39;m getting an uncaught TypeError whenever I try to access rows. I&#39;m really not sure whats causing this. \r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n",
