I have a tkinter module with two buttons to launch file_X and file_Y. So if I click button A, I want file_X to run and button B would launch file_Y. How can I run these files in parallel and have them display the data in their respective command prompt terminals?</p>\n\n<p>I tried using runpy and os.system. os.system would throw me an error even though the modules for both files were working fine on their own. On the other hand, runpy wouldn't let me click on the other button while the first module was running. </p>\n\n<p>Tkinter module:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import tkinter as tk\nimport time\n\nimport runpy\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot. title(\"App\")\nroot.geometry('700x500')\n\nv = tk.IntVar()\nv.set(-1)\n\nbutton_labels = [\n    (\" Device 1 \"),\n    (\" Device 2 \")]\n\ndef ShowChoice():\n    choice = v.get() + 1\n    if(choice == 1):\n        runpy.run_module('file_X', run_name='__main__')\n\n    elif(choice == 2):\n        runpy.run_module('file_Y', run_name='__main__')\n\ntk.Label(root, \n         text=\"\"\"Choose the device you want to launch:\"\"\",\n         font = 'Arial 20 bold',\n         justify = tk.LEFT,\n         height = 6,\n         padx = 20).pack()\n\nfor val, button_label in enumerate(button_labels):\n    tk.Radiobutton(root,\n                   text = button_label,\n                   font = 'Times 12 bold',\n                   indicatoron = 0,\n                   bg = 'cornflower blue',\n                   width = 40,\n                   padx = 20,\n                   pady = 5,\n                   variable=v,\n                   command=ShowChoice,\n                   value=val).pack(anchor=tk.S)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>file_X and file_Y have pretty much the same code but are connected to different COM Ports and have different string modifications.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import serial\nimport time\nimport csv\n\ntry:\nser = serial.Serial(\"COM4\",\n                     baudrate=2400,\n                     bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS,\n                     parity =serial.PARITY_ODD)\n\nexcept:\n        print(\"Device not detected\")   \n\ndef Reader():\n    global ser\n    try:                    \n        data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8')\n        data = str(data).replace(\"\\r\\n\",\"\")\n        data = data.replace(\"\\x000\",\"\")\n        return data\n    except:\n        return \"Data Unavailable\"\n\ndef Start():\n    date_now = time.strftime('%d.%m.%y')\n    time_now = time.strftime('%H.%M.%S')\n    file_name = date_now + '__' + time_now + '.csv'\n\n    with open(file_name, 'w+') as f:\n        csv_file = csv.writer(f)\n        csv_file.writerow(['DATE','TIME','VALUE'])  \n\n        while True:\n            date_now = time.strftime('%d/%m/%y')\n            time_now = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')\n            data = Reader()\n            csv_file.writerow([date_now, time_now, data])\n            print([date_now, time_now, data])\n\nif __name__ =='__main__':\n\n    Start()\n</code></pre>\n"
