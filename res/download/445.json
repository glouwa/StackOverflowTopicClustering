I used a <code>switch</code> statement to discriminate by the hostname, allowing me to have 1 centralized/synced <code>.bash_profile</code>, which contains a separate set of aliases and functions for each machine it works on (e.g. work related stuff on my work computer, and person side-project related stuff on my personal computer).</p>\n\n<p>I know autoloading functions in <code>~/.config/fish/functions</code> are <code>fish</code>'s equivalent of unconditionally defined functions in <code>bash</code>'s in <code>.bash_profile</code>.

            "body": "<p>With my Raspberry PI 3 I am trying to control an dual relay over internet , the Python codes are ok , I tested them and they are working just fine . The problem is the PHP code , I don't have any idea how to make the website . I just want to show 2 buttons , one with Relay ON and one with Relay OFF , I found one on the internet , this is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/style.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n\n&lt;?php\nif (isset($_POST['LightON']))\n{\nexec(\"sudo python /home/pi/relay1on.py\");\n}\nif (isset($_POST['LightOFF']))\n{\nexec(\"sudo python /home/pi/relay1off.py\");\n}\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n&lt;button class=\"btn\" name=\"LightON\"&gt;Light ON&lt;/button&gt;&amp;nbsp;\n&lt;button class=\"btn\" name=\"LightOFF\"&gt;Light OFF&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I made a nano with the code (originally it was for switching a light on and off , with relay of course , just edited a bit so it will exec the python that I need when the button is pressed) and put it in /var/www/html/</p>\n\n<p>I get what I should get , but the buttons won't work.I can touch them but the page just refreshes and the relay is doing nothing.\nIf someone could help me I would apreciate.Thanks in advance</p>\n"
