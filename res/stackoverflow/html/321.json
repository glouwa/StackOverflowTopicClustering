Further, because the computer runs in UTC because of the ever-changing time zones of my job, there is a cell F5, that gives the time zone as a number. Is there a way to tell excel to add(or subtract) that number when putting in the date (thinking if I need a time stamp for 2200 april 4 when the computer reads 0100 on the 5th UTC and i&#39;m in zone 3.)
