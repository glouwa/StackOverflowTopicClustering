In other words, I cannot get the actual value in the cells to be \"05/05/2018\", it always generates it as \"5/5/2018\".  I first attempted to change the format of it, but this just changes the format and not the data.</p>\n\n<p>The dates in the \"360\" database connection get pulled in as text as \"MM/DD/YYYY\" and in order to compare the dates from both worksheets to see when then are a match I need to format the dates in the \"Test\" worksheet to be \"MM/DD/YYYY\".
