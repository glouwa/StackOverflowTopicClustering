In the blockchain class I am creating an initial block called the gensis block in the createGenesisBlock() method. In the constructor of my blockchain class I am calling the createGenesisBlock() method and inserting the object into my linked-list which is called chain. The problem I have is when the object is added to the linked-list in my blockchain class I cannot access the object or the methods. What I am trying to accomplish is to use my getLatestBlock() method in the blockchain class to retrieve the value of hash of the last object that was put into chain.
