I am running postgreSQL 9.3 on Windows 8, am doing data analytics, and my desktop has 24GB RAM, an i7 4-core processor, and a 7200rpm hdd with 32GB SSD cache using intel smart response.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though postgreSQL is not taking full advantage of the computer and I am wondering what more I might need to do in terms of tuning.\r\n\r\npgtune made the following changes to postgresql.conf:\r\n\r\n - default_statistics_target = 100\r\n - maintenance_work_mem = 480MB\r\n - constraint_exclusion = on\r\n - checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9\r\n - effective_cache_size = 2816MB\r\n - work_mem = 96MB\r\n - wal_buffers = 32MB\r\n - checkpoint_segments = 64\r\n - shared_buffers = 960MB\r\n - max_connections = 20\r\n\r\nNow I run this complex self join, count with group by query on the 5GB table &quot;training&quot; which has 100 million rows and four integer columns:\r\n    \r\n    SELECT t1.m_id, t2.m_id, count(*)\r\n    FROM training t1, training t2\r\n    WHERE t1.u_id = t2.u_id AND t1.m_id &lt; t2.m_id\r\n    GROUP BY t1.m_id, t2.m_id\r\n\r\nEXPLAIN revealed the following query plan:\r\n\r\n    GroupAggregate  (cost=4984590388.65..5216672318.82 rows=25381444 width=8)\r\n      -&gt;  Sort  (cost=4984590388.65..5042547417.59 rows=23182811573 width=8)\r\n            Sort Key: t1.m_id, t2.m_id\r\n            -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.57..676446040.92 rows=23182811573 width=8)\r\n                  -&gt;  Seq Scan on training t1  (cost=0.00..1621754.12 rows=99072112 width=8)\r\n                  -&gt;  Index Only Scan using training_u_id_m_id_idx on training t2  (cos=0.57..4.90 rows=191 width=8)\r\n                        Index Cond: ((u_id = t1.u_id) AND (m_id &gt; t1.m_id))\r\n\r\nIt has been running for 8 hours, but what interested me is what task manager revealed. The PostgreSQL Server process is using only:\r\n\r\n - 15% CPU\r\n - 6.1% Memory (about 512MB)\r\n - 3.5% Disk\r\n\r\nNo other processes are taking significant amounts of resources. It surprises me that postgreSQL would not use more of the available resources given the complexity of the query, does anyone have an idea of what might be going on? Do my `pgtune` values seem good?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve done a little research as well which has told me that:\r\n\r\n1. On Windows `shared_buffers` should not be greater than 512MB, and that system cache should be used instead. Question: Do I have to somehow tell Windows to allocate system cache to postgreSQL or will this happen automatically if postgreSQL requests it?\r\n2. `work_mem` allows the database server to do sorts in RAM if it is large enough. Question: Is my work_mem large enough for this? How can I tell whether sorts are being done in RAM or on disk?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any insight at all to help speed up this query. Thanks!",

            "title": "Tuning postgreSQL on Windows desktop to take advantage of 24GB RAM",
            "body": "<p>I am new to tuning postgreSQL but have read this standard guide: <a href=\"https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server</a>\nand have used pgtune to get some configuration recommendations. I am running postgreSQL 9.3 on Windows 8, am doing data analytics, and my desktop has 24GB RAM, an i7 4-core processor, and a 7200rpm hdd with 32GB SSD cache using intel smart response.</p>\n\n<p>It seems as though postgreSQL is not taking full advantage of the computer and I am wondering what more I might need to do in terms of tuning.</p>\n\n<p>pgtune made the following changes to postgresql.conf:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>default_statistics_target = 100</li>\n<li>maintenance_work_mem = 480MB</li>\n<li>constraint_exclusion = on</li>\n<li>checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9</li>\n<li>effective_cache_size = 2816MB</li>\n<li>work_mem = 96MB</li>\n<li>wal_buffers = 32MB</li>\n<li>checkpoint_segments = 64</li>\n<li>shared_buffers = 960MB</li>\n<li>max_connections = 20</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I run this complex self join, count with group by query on the 5GB table \"training\" which has 100 million rows and four integer columns:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT t1.m_id, t2.m_id, count(*)\nFROM training t1, training t2\nWHERE t1.u_id = t2.u_id AND t1.m_id &lt; t2.m_id\nGROUP BY t1.m_id, t2.m_id\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EXPLAIN revealed the following query plan:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GroupAggregate  (cost=4984590388.65..5216672318.82 rows=25381444 width=8)\n  -&gt;  Sort  (cost=4984590388.65..5042547417.59 rows=23182811573 width=8)\n        Sort Key: t1.m_id, t2.m_id\n        -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.57..676446040.92 rows=23182811573 width=8)\n              -&gt;  Seq Scan on training t1  (cost=0.00..1621754.12 rows=99072112 width=8)\n              -&gt;  Index Only Scan using training_u_id_m_id_idx on training t2  (cos=0.57..4.90 rows=191 width=8)\n                    Index Cond: ((u_id = t1.u_id) AND (m_id &gt; t1.m_id))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It has been running for 8 hours, but what interested me is what task manager revealed. The PostgreSQL Server process is using only:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>15% CPU</li>\n<li>6.1% Memory (about 512MB)</li>\n<li>3.5% Disk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No other processes are taking significant amounts of resources. It surprises me that postgreSQL would not use more of the available resources given the complexity of the query, does anyone have an idea of what might be going on? Do my pgtune values seem good?</p>\n\n<p>I've done a little research as well which has told me that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On Windows <code>shared_buffers</code> should not be greater than 512MB, and that system cache should be used instead. Question: Do I have to somehow tell Windows to allocate system cache to postgreSQL or will this happen automatically if postgreSQL requests it?</li>\n<li><code>work_mem</code> allows the database server to do sorts in RAM if it is large enough. Question: Is my work_mem large enough for this? How can I tell whether sorts are being done in RAM or on disk?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any insight at all to help speed up this query. Thanks!</p>\n"
