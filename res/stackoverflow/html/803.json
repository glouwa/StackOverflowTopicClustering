            "body": "<p>Dear Community Members,</p>\n\n<p>I have a situation here ! One of the VM running on OVS 3.2.11 is stuck and I tried to kill it from OVMM but that didn't work. I also tried to use xm destroy command but it hangs indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>Could you please share your thoughts on how to debug, where to look the logs(I have checked all the default log locations) but no clue. Could you please share what could have been wrong with this VM. All the other VMs responds normal.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance..</p>\n"

What I want to do is place the menu circles I have created above the images on each side of the page.  I tried placing them within header tags, but that didn&#39;t work either.  Overall, I will need to add at least one more circle to the 7 I have already.  I can resize the circles/text as needed, but I do want them to overlap slightly.  I believe I have included all needed code.  I would prefer to keep this within the realm of HTML if at all possible.  \r\n\r\n    &lt;body class=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;menu-container&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;ca-menu&quot;&gt;\r\n\t    &lt;li&gt;\r\n\t\t    &lt;a href=&quot;AndersonBradHomePage.html&quot;

What I want to do is place the menu circles I have created above the images on each side of the page.  I tried placing them within header tags, but that didn't work either.  Overall, I will need to add at least one more circle to the 7 I have already.  I can resize the circles/text as needed, but I do want them to overlap slightly.  I believe I have included all needed code.  I would prefer to keep this within the realm of HTML if at all possible.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;body class=\"homepage\"&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"menu-container\"&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"AndersonBradHomePage.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"OscarTrivia.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oscar Trivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"EmmyTrivia.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emmy Trivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"OscarWinners.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oscar Winners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"EmmyWinners.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emmy Winners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;   \n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"PretendBestPicture.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Picture???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ul class=\"ca-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"EmmyChange.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"ca-icon\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change Emmys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;   \n\n\n&lt;h5 id=\"footer\"&gt;&amp;copy; BPA Productions 2018&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n.homepage {\n    background-image: url(pagepics/big_oscar.png), url(pagepics/emmy.png);\n    background-position: left, right;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size: 220px, 220px;       \n    padding: 250px;\n}\n\nh2 {\n    font-size: 30px;\n    color: white;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nh3 {\n    font-size: 27.5px;\n    color: cornflowerblue;\n}\n\n#footer {\n    background-color: #000;\n    color: red;\n    text-align: center;\n    height: 60px;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 0;\n}\n\nli h3 {\n    margin: .1px 0;\n}\n\n.menu-container {\n    text-align:center;\n}\n\n.ca-menu {\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 50px auto;\n    width: 140px;\n    display:inline-block;\n}\n\n.ca-menu li{\n    width: 150px;\n    height: 150px;\n    /*Circle Size*/\n    border: 10px solid blue;\n    /*border color before spin*/\n    overflow: hidden;\n    position: relative;\n    float:left;\n    background: red;\n    /*background before spin*/\n    margin-right: 10px;\n    box-shadow: 5px 5px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n    border-radius: 125px;\n    /*circle vs square*/\n    transition: all 1000ms linear;\n}\n\n.ca-menu li a{\n    text-align: left;\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    color: white;\n    /*text color before spin*/\n    position:relative;\n}\n\n.ca-icon{\n    font-size: 18px;\n    text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #101254;\n    line-height: 135px;\n    position: static;\n    padding-left: 15px;\n    width: 50px;\n    left: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n    transition: all 900ms linear;\n}\n\n.ca-content{\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 120px;\n    width: 370px;\n    height: 50px;\n    top: 20px;\n}\n\n.ca-menu li:hover{\n    background: blue;\n    border-color: red;\n    transform: rotate(1440deg);\n} /* colors after spin*/\n\n.ca-menu li:hover .ca-icon{\n    color: #BEFC00;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    /*text size after spin*/\n}\n\n.ca-menu li:hover .ca-main{\n    display: none;\n}\n\n.ca-menu li:hover .ca-sub{\n    opacity: 8.0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
