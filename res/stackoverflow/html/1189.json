            "title": "Inserting a POJO with a JsonNode field into MongoDB using Java driver",
            "body": "<p>Im using Mongo Java driver 3.7</p>\n\n<p>This is my POJO(with getters and setters) - </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Sample{\n    public int field1;\n    public JsonNode field2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Im using the below code to insert an object of Sample into MongoDB.</p>\n\n<pre><code>MongoCollection&lt;Sample&gt; myCollection = database.getCollection(\"myCollection\",Sample.class);\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    Sample obj = new Sample();\n    obj.setField1(1);\n    String sampleJSON = \"{ \\\"key\\\": \\\"value\\\" }\";\n    obj.setField2(mapper.readTree(sample));\n\nmyCollection.insertOne(obj);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Seen Output: (<strong>JsonNode field is empty</strong>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5afbff8a8f621e1e328a8c4e\"),\n    \"field1\" : 1\n    \"field2\" : [\n                 [ ]\n               ],\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note:\nIn debug mode, it is clear that the JsonNode is created with proper data. But insert is misbehaving.\nI guess I'm missing something here. Any leads appreciated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nI tried writing a custom codec for JsonNode class, but it is never being used by mongo. This is my codec code -</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Slf4j\npublic class JsonNodeCodec implements CollectibleCodec&lt;JsonNode&gt; {\n    @Inject\n    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;\n\n    @Override\n    public JsonNode generateIdIfAbsentFromDocument(JsonNode jsonNode) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean documentHasId(JsonNode jsonNode) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public BsonValue getDocumentId(JsonNode jsonNode) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JsonNode decode(BsonReader reader, DecoderContext decoderContext) {\n        String task = reader.readString();\n        JsonNode node = objectMapper.readTree(task);\n        return node;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void encode(BsonWriter writer, JsonNode jsonNode, EncoderContext encoderContext) {\n        writer.writeString(jsonNode.toString());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Class&lt;JsonNode&gt; getEncoderClass() {\n        return JsonNode.class;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I'm registering the codec like this - </p>\n\n<pre><code>Codec&lt;JsonNode&gt; jsonNodeCodec = new JsonNodeCodec();\nCodecRegistry codecRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(com.mongodb.MongoClient.getDefaultCodecRegistry(),\n            CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(jsonNodeCodec),\n            CodecRegistries.fromProviders(PojoCodecProvider.builder().automatic(true).build())\n    );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PS: Other codecs registered for custom POJOs are working fine. But this codec is never being used to encode/decode JSON objects</p>\n"
