I was able to find [this][2] answer which is right on point in explaining that `Counter()` is designed to count and not sum, per se.\r\n\r\nI can recreate the example and get it to work, but with a django queryset,  when coupled with the `Counter()` method, generates a more complex dictionary that looks like this. \r\n\r\n    totals = {\r\n        &#39;sumthing_a&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 48000}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_b&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 39050}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_c&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 8950}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_d&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 10000}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_e&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 17200}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_f&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 17750}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_g&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 30450}),\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried variations of:\r\n\r\n    totals.update({&#39;sumthing_e&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 300})})\r\n\r\nwhich replaces the original 17200 with 300 rather than adding them.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried:\r\n\r\n    totals[&#39;sumthing_e&#39;].update({&#39;sumthing_e&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 300})})\r\n\r\nwhich throws:  `unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;Counter&#39; and &#39;int&#39;`\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `.update()` states:\r\n\r\n&gt; Elements are counted from an iterable or added-in from another mapping\r\n&gt; (or counter). Like dict.update() but adds counts instead of replacing\r\n&gt; them. Also, the iterable is expected to be a sequence of elements, not\r\n&gt; a sequence of (key, value) pairs.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a docs note that states:\r\n\r\n&gt; For in-place operations such as c[key] += 1, the value type need only\r\n&gt; support addition and subtraction. So fractions, floats, and decimals\r\n&gt; would work and negative values are supported. The same is also true\r\n&gt; for update() and subtract() which allow negative and zero values for\r\n&gt; both inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that what I&#39;m trying to do is possible, if it is coded correctly.  The final result should be the ability to have a negative number - as an example:\r\n\r\n    totals = {\r\n        &#39;sumthing_a&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 48000}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_b&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: -40503}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_c&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 8950}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_d&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 10000}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_e&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: -58462}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_f&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 17750}), \r\n        &#39;sumthing_g&#39;: Counter({&#39;total&#39;: 30450}),\r\n        }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50341867/django-property-used-in-aggregate\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/42717000/3180386",
