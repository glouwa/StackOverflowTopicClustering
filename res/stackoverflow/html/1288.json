list view as dynamic using volley?\r\nwhen i used &quot;jsonschema2pojo site&quot; , this site gave 9 model classes?\r\nso any way I parsed data with key id&#39;s of 1 and 1027 then if parse with other keys , it will going a big code?\r\nso My question is : how can i get that key id&#39;s data in listview and how can i  implement as dynamic??\r\nin adapter also used switch case ,I thought if using switch as per json key id&#39;s it will be going to increasing big coding ?\r\nso how can i get data in listview\r\nplease helm me?\r\n ",

doing as static with parsing data with json key id's,\nso that is not correct getting data using of volley,\nhow can i parse in list view as dynamic using volley?\nwhen i used \"jsonschema2pojo site\" , this site gave 9 model classes?\nso any way I parsed data with key id's of 1 and 1027 then if parse with other keys , it will going a big code?\nso My question is : how can i get that key id's data in listview and how can i  implement as dynamic??\nin adapter also used switch case ,I thought if using switch as per json key id's it will be going to increasing big coding ?\nso how can i get data in listview\nplease helm me?</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>I have two C++ classes such that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first class contains a pointer to the second class and has template function that calls second class's public method through a pointer. The function is defined already in the class declaration, for the reason of being a template.</li>\n<li>The second class allows the first class to access its private members through friendship mechanism. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given that, my question is: how do I organize the sources/headers/forward declarations for this situation?\nWhatever I tried, it just doesn't compile to an object file.</p>\n\n<p>One sequence is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Class2;\n\nclass Class1\n{\n        Class2 * c2;\npublic:\n        template&lt;typename T&gt; T DoSomething(T&amp; X)\n        {\n                c2-&gt;Func();\n                return X;\n        };\n\n        void FuncFromClass1();\n\n};\n\nclass Class2\n{\n        int data;\npublic:\n        Class2() : data(0) {};\n        void Func();\n        friend void Class1::FuncFromClass1();\n};\n\nvoid Class2::Func()\n{\n        int i;\n}\n\nvoid Class1::FuncFromClass1()\n{\n        int j;\n        c2 = new Class2;\n        c2-&gt;data = 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Barks <code>invalid use of incomplete type ‘class Class2’</code> because it doesn't recognize <code>c2-&gt;Func();</code>. \nThe other one is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Class1;\n\nclass Class2\n{\n        int data;\npublic:\n        Class2() : data(0) {};\n        void Func();\n        friend void Class1::FuncFromClass1();\n};\n\nclass Class1\n{\n        Class2 * c2;\npublic:\n        template&lt;typename T&gt; T DoSomething(T&amp; X)\n        {\n                c2-&gt;Func();\n                return X;\n        };\n\n        void FuncFromClass1();\n\n}; \n\nvoid Class2::Func()\n{\n        int i;\n}\n\nvoid Class1::FuncFromClass1()\n{\n        int j;\n        c2 = new Class2;\n        c2-&gt;data = 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Doesn't recognize <code>friend void Class1::FuncFromClass1();</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The compilation is tried as <code>g++ -c -std=c++11 -Wall test.cpp</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note I'd rather not make <code>Class1</code> as entire friend, rather want to keep only one of its methods as a friend to <code>Class2</code>, if at all possible.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I haven't tried the exact same example in Visual Studio in Windows, but saw an entirely isomorphic situation like the one described (within a bigger project) and no complaints came from VS as far as I recall. Is it unique to g++?</p>\n"
