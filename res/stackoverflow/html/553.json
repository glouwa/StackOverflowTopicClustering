The form has two message divs with &#39;display: none&#39; that show on either success or error states. The submit script works fine on chrome, firefox and Safari for desktop. However, on Chrome for iOS, both of the messages are displayed (without correct styling) without interacting with the form at all.\r\n\r\nWhy is this? I can&#39;t seem to work out if this is a styling or AJAX/Javascript incompatibility in Chrome for iOS. I would appreciate it if anyone at all could help me out here.
