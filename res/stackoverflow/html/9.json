This is the query i have written to fetch the details for the same,</p>\n\n<pre><code>select DISTINCT tbl_CreateFreeBet.FreeBetID, \n        tbl_CreateFreeBet.FreeBetDescription, \n        tbl_CreateFreeBet.FreeBetAmount, \n        tbl_CreateFreeBet.TournamentID, \n        tbl_CreateFreeBet.MatchID, \n        tbl_UserFreeBets.UserForYes, \n        tbl_UserFreeBets.UserForNo, \n        tbl_UserFreeBets.UserForNoBets  \nfrom tbl_CreateFreeBet left outer join tbl_UserFreeBets\non tbl_CreateFreeBet.MatchID = 1 and\ntbl_CreateFreeBet.MatchID = tbl_UserFreeBets.MatchID and \ntbl_CreateFreeBet.FreeBetID = tbl_UserFreeBets.FreeBetID and \ntbl_CreateFreeBet.TournamentID = tbl_UserFreeBets.TournamentID and \n(tbl_UserFreeBets.UserForYes = 'User2' or tbl_UserFreeBets.UserForNo = \n'User2')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is working fine, when there is a data in tbl_CreateFreeBet table for the MatchID. But if there is no data, then this query is not returning the expected result.</p>\n\n<p>For example: With tbl_CreateFreeBet.MatchID = 1, I need to get all the free bets of matchID = 1, with the details of the passed in user, if has bet on 'yes' or 'no'. This comes up fine, as there is data for MatchId = 1 in tbl_CreateFreeBet.</p>\n\n<p>But, it fails, when the tbl_CreateFreeBet.MatchID = 2 input is passed. Here there is no free bet created for the MatchID = 2. But still it returns me the result for MatchID=1.</p>\n\n<p>Please share the query if one is aware of what changes need to be done for my query. Thank you.</p>\n"

The deploy is done through bitbucket, it runs task specified in scripts.postinstall of package.json.</p>\n\n<p>Everything looks fine and I can see the following output in the bitbucket's console:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Running \"less:dev\" (less) task</code></p>\n  \n  <p><code>remote: &gt;&gt; 1 stylesheet created.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But when I run the app it can't find the output css file. I can't figure out how to see what's exactly on the server because if I just pull from the heroku's git it won't show me everything (this file is included in gitignore as generated).</p>\n\n<p>So I think that maybe I should show in the console the path to the css output file but I don't know how to do that. My code from grunt:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>grunt.initConfig({\n  /* 1 - Compile LESS to CSS */\n  less: {\n    dev: {\n        files: 'public/styles/dist/site.css': ['public/styles/**/*.less', '!public/styles/login.less'\n        }\n    }\n  },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>BTW locally everything is generated well.</p>\n"
