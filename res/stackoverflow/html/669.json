            "body_markdown": "Why is adding a sparse and a full matrix slower than adding two full matrices? The following code demonstrates consistent superior performance for `hFullAddFull`.\r\n\r\n    I_FULL = 600;\r\n    J_FULL = 10000;\r\n    FULL_COUNT = I_FULL*J_FULL;\r\n    NON_ZERO_ELEMENT_COUNT = 1000;\r\n\r\n    nonZeroIdxs = randsample(FULL_COUNT, NON_ZERO_ELEMENT_COUNT);\r\n    mat_Sp = spalloc(I_FULL, J_FULL, NON_ZERO_ELEMENT_COUNT);\r\n    mat_Sp(nonZeroIdxs) = 0.5;\r\n    mat_Full = full(mat_Sp);\r\n\r\n    otherMat_Full = rand(I_FULL, J_FULL);\r\n\r\n    hFullAddSp = @()otherMat_Full+mat_Sp;\r\n    hFullAddFull = @()otherMat_Full+mat_Full;\r\n\r\n    timeit(hFullAddSp)\r\n    timeit(hFullAddFull)\r\n\r\nFor me this is important as the addition occurs within a critical piece of code that is called 10,000s of times, so the small performance decrease for the sparse addition is critical. I would rather keep my code with the sparse type as input to the calculation and having the final matrix as a full matrix. Surely the 1000 elements of the full matrix can simply be modified? What is going on underneath here? Is there a way to make the sparse/full addition faster? Would a mex implementation be faster?\r\n\r\nOn my machine `hFullAddFull` is 30% faster.",
