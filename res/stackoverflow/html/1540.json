button, it will jump to &quot;lu.jsp&quot; and in &quot;lu.jsp&quot; you can see it will to &quot;listPatient.jsp&quot; and then print each patient&#39;s information. However, it does not work. And then I typed &quot;lu.jsp&quot; in my browser, it also shows the same &quot;500 internal error&quot;. Then I typed &quot;listPatient.jsp&quot; in the browser, it shows no error, but there is no patient information in the webpage. So I think maybe I do not grad patient information correctly? what is wrong? thanks!\r\n",

and in \"lu.jsp\" you can see it will to \"listPatient.jsp\" and then print each patient's information. However, it does not work. And then I typed \"lu.jsp\" in my browser, it also shows the same \"500 internal error\". Then I typed \"listPatient.jsp\" in the browser, it shows no error, but there is no patient information in the webpage. So I think maybe I do not grad patient information correctly? what is wrong? thanks!</p>\n"
