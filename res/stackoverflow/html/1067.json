Also, that question does not show the full error received, so I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s exactly the same error. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUpdate: Below is the code that pertains to this question. Basically, the server starts an express server which uses the POST authWithIdToken route to set a cookie containing the user&#39;s firebase auth idToken. It uses authenticationMiddleware to check for a cookie with idToken, and if it exists, then to decode the token and fetch the user&#39;s data. The errors occur at the getUser(uid) step. The `getFirebaseAdminInitConfig` function gets the init config, which is provided using ENV variables.\r\n\r\n    # server.js - excerpt showing authentication middleware and authWithIdTokenRoute\r\n    const server = express()\r\n    # ...\r\n    allowParsingPostBody(server)\r\n    server.use(cookieParser())\r\n    server.use(&#39;*&#39;, authenticationMiddleware)\r\n    server.post(&#39;/authWithIdToken&#39;, authWithIdTokenRoute)\r\n    # ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    # authenticationMiddleware.js\r\n    const { FIREBASE_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE } = require(&#39;../universal/constants&#39;)\r\n    const firebaseAdmin = require(&#39;firebase-admin&#39;)\r\n    const winston = require(&#39;winston&#39;)\r\n    const getFirebaseAdminInitConfig = require(&#39;./getFirebaseAdminInitConfig&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    winston.info(\r\n      &#39;Initializing Firebase Admin with Config:&#39;,\r\n      getFirebaseAdminInitConfig()\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    firebaseAdmin.initializeApp(getFirebaseAdminInitConfig())\r\n    \r\n    async function decodeToken (firebaseIdToken) {\r\n      try {\r\n        const decodedToken = await firebaseAdmin.auth().verifyIdToken(firebaseIdToken)\r\n        return decodedToken\r\n      } catch (error) {\r\n        if (error.code !== &#39;auth/internal-error&#39;) throw error\r\n        winston.warn(\r\n          &#39;firebase admin auth verifyIdToken auth/internal-error:&#39;,\r\n          {\r\n            firebaseIdToken,\r\n            error\r\n          }\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const getFullUrl = (req) =&gt;

Basically, the server starts an express server which uses the POST authWithIdToken route to set a cookie containing the user's firebase auth idToken. It uses authenticationMiddleware to check for a cookie with idToken, and if it exists, then to decode the token and fetch the user's data. The errors occur at the getUser(uid) step.

The process works but the **image is corrupt or cropped** sometimes.\r\n\r\n[Broken Image example 1][1]\r\n\r\n[Correct Image example 2][2] \r\n\r\n**Is there a better way to go about this?

It is however possible that the output to the browser did not complete? No good method of testing as I only get perfectly fine PDF&#39;s but can see the resulting bad images on disk.\r\n\r\nTried changing the process to use the chart_hidden.getImageURI() from gchart to directly place it in the pdf but only got a broken pdf.\r\n\r\n**The process is as follows:**\r\n \r\n1. Page with inputs is built with a div for the graph image (id = chart_div_hidden) and a div for the displayed graph (id = chart_div). \r\n\r\n2. Create pdf link triggered calling jQuery that empties chart_div_hidden before creating the gchart LineChart google.visualization.LineChart (image dimensions are set here)\r\n\r\n3. Ajax call to save image to disk\r\n\r\n4. on success: Ajax to build mpdf is triggered with necessary fields and image filename passed over.
