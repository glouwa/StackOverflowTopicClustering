            "body": "<p>I have daywise excel data of four months which contains hourly data from 10 AM to 3 PM or sometimes 10 AM to 2 PM....1PM ..... like wise it is varying. The column A contains the date, Column B contains the time and column C and D has the data which i want to average for each day and multiply it to the number of occurrence.\nFor example If I have a data in column C and D for 17 Oct from 10 AM to 3PM (6 Hours)..Then i want to average these hourly data for a day and multiply it by 6. Since my interval of hourly data is not fixed, that is why i want a code which can average the daywise data and multiply it to the number of occurrence. I want to average the data 1 and data 2 for each day and to multiply its average by the number of occurrence of data in that particular day\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqXYO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqXYO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"
