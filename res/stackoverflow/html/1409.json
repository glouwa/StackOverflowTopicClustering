            "body": "<p>How on earth do I use an https proxy with http2 in nodejs. I've tried looking around and I can't find any info on it. Take for example the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const client = http2.connect('https://twitter.com');\nconst req = client.request({':method': 'GET', ':path': '/', ':authority': 'twitter.com', ':scheme': 'https', 'Cookie': loadCookies(cookiejar) });\nreq.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\nvar body = \"\";\nreq.on('response', (responseHeaders) =&gt; {\nstoreCookies(responseHeaders, cookiejar);\n});\n\nreq.on('data', (chunk) =&gt; {\n    body += chunk;\n});\nreq.on('end', () =&gt;{ \n\n    client.destroy();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So how would I go about routing this request through a proxy, say for example Charles where the proxy would be set 127.0.0.1:8888.</p>\n"
