            "body_markdown": "I am having a website (Angular App) which I can reach on https://localhost:4200 and a server (pure REST API) that is on https://localhost:8443. \r\n\r\nSince the REST endpoints are secured, a user must login on my server. Obviously I want users to be able to signup using Facebook and further communicate with my server after login.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAccording to [the docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-social/docs/2.0.0.M4/reference/htmlsingle/#enabling-provider-sign-in-with-code-providersignincontroller-code)\r\n\r\n&gt; `POST /signin/{providerId}` - Initiates the sign in flow. \r\n\r\nthat is why there is a button that does just this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form ngNoForm name=&quot;fb_signin&quot; id=&quot;fb_signin&quot; action=&quot;https://localhost:8443/signin/facebook&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;scope&quot; value=&quot;email&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;SIGNING&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom there, everything works fine for some time. The user gets redirected to Facebook&#39;s authorization page where the authorization button gets clicked. After that the user gets redirected to https://localhost:8443/signin/facebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIt seems that per default, in case the user is unknown, there will be a another redirect to https://localhost:8443/signup ([see docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-social/docs/2.0.0.M4/reference/htmlsingle/#enabling-provider-sign-in-with-code-providersignincontroller-code)) \r\n\r\n&gt; If the provider user ID matches more than one existing connection, `ProviderSignInController` will redirect to the application’s sign in URL to offer the user a chance to sign in through another provider or with their username and password. The request to the sign in URL will have an &quot;`error`&quot; query parameter set to &quot;`multiple_users`&quot; to indicate the problem so that the page can communicate it to the user. The default sign in URL is &quot;`/signin`&quot; (relative to the application root), but can be customized by setting the `signInUrl` property.\r\n\r\nOn my serer this looks like this ([borrowed from a sample application][1]):\r\n\r\n\r\n    @RequestMapping(value = &quot;/signup&quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)\r\n    public SignUpForm signupForm(WebRequest request) {\r\n        Connection&lt;?&gt; connection = providerSignInUtils.getConnectionFromSession(request);\r\n        if (connection != null) {\r\n            request.setAttribute(&quot;message&quot;, new Message(MessageType.INFO, &quot;Your &quot; + StringUtils.capitalize(connection.getKey().getProviderId()) + &quot; account is not associated with a Spring Social Showcase account.

            "body": "<p>I am having a website (Angular App) which I can reach on <a href=\"https://localhost:4200\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://localhost:4200</a> and a server (pure REST API) that is on <a href=\"https://localhost:8443\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://localhost:8443</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Since the REST endpoints are secured, a user must login on my server. Obviously I want users to be able to signup using Facebook and further communicate with my server after login.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-social/docs/2.0.0.M4/reference/htmlsingle/#enabling-provider-sign-in-with-code-providersignincontroller-code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the docs</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>POST /signin/{providerId}</code> - Initiates the sign in flow. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that is why there is a button that does just this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form ngNoForm name=\"fb_signin\" id=\"fb_signin\" action=\"https://localhost:8443/signin/facebook\" method=\"POST\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"scope\" value=\"email\"&gt;\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;SIGNING&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From there, everything works fine for some time. The user gets redirected to Facebook's authorization page where the authorization button gets clicked. After that the user gets redirected to <a href=\"https://localhost:8443/signin/facebook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://localhost:8443/signin/facebook</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It seems that per default, in case the user is unknown, there will be a another redirect to <a href=\"https://localhost:8443/signup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://localhost:8443/signup</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-social/docs/2.0.0.M4/reference/htmlsingle/#enabling-provider-sign-in-with-code-providersignincontroller-code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see docs</a>) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the provider user ID matches more than one existing connection, <code>ProviderSignInController</code> will redirect to the application’s sign in URL to offer the user a chance to sign in through another provider or with their username and password. The request to the sign in URL will have an \"<code>error</code>\" query parameter set to \"<code>multiple_users</code>\" to indicate the problem so that the page can communicate it to the user. The default sign in URL is \"<code>/signin</code>\" (relative to the application root), but can be customized by setting the <code>signInUrl</code> property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On my serer this looks like this (<a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-samples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">borrowed from a sample application</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = \"/signup\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic SignUpForm signupForm(WebRequest request) {\n    Connection&lt;?&gt; connection = providerSignInUtils.getConnectionFromSession(request);\n    if (connection != null) {\n        request.setAttribute(\"message\", new Message(MessageType.INFO, \"Your \" + StringUtils.capitalize(connection.getKey().getProviderId()) + \" account is not associated with a Spring Social Showcase account.

            "body": "<p>I'm using the \"Add Service Reference\" option in Visual Studio in order to create a proxy class using a WSDL file given to me by a third party.\nI got 2 versions of the WSDL - we'll call them \"OLD\" and \"NEW\".</p>\n\n<p>Even though the WSDL files suppose to be the same (the new one got updated methods version) , when creating the proxy classes I get a different values in the OperationContractAttribute.Action.</p>\n\n<p>In the OLD wsdl it looks like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute(Action=\"http://webservices.amadeus.com/SATRQT_13_2_1A\", ReplyAction=\"*\")]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the new wsdl it looks like that:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>[System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute(Action=\"http://xml.amadeus.com/AmadeusWebServicesPT/Air_MultiAvailabilityRequest\", ReplyAction=\"http://xml.amadeus.com/AmadeusWebServicesPT/Air_MultiAvailabilityResponse\")]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can't figure it out from where the \"Action\" value is taken from.</p>\n\n<p>In the old WSDL the value is valid , but in the new WSDL is completely wrong and I get an exception when trying to use the service in the WS</p>\n\n<p>When I look in the OLD wsdl file i can see a \"soapAction\" with the same value; this seems to be where it's taken from. However in the NEW wsdl there is a value there exactly like in the OLD wsdl</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;wsdl:operation name=\"Air_MultiAvailability\"&gt;\n  &lt;soap:operation soapAction=\"http://webservices.amadeus.com/SATRQT_13_2_1A\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can anyone direct to me to the right place? </p>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>After reading some more on the \"Action\" element I realized that the value that I see in the NEW wsdl is the DEFAULT value (see <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute.action(v=vs.110).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute.action(v=vs.110).aspx</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Now I need to understand WHY in the OLD wsdl file we get the Action value to be the correct one (I'm guessing from the <em>soapAction</em> defined in the wsdl file under the correct operation) and in the NEW wsdl there is no match and a default value is populated ?</p>\n"
