That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.\r\n\r\n**Question(s)**: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any &quot;gotchas&quot; you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here? Thank you for your help! ",

Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>\n\n<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis \"loose coupling between modules\", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any \"gotchas\" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here? Thank you for your help! </p>\n"

            "body": "<p>I'm using monogame as a framework for games and I'm trying to implement a in-app-purchase-functionality in an UWP-App which throws an exception when I'm calling <code>RequestProductPurchaseAsync</code>. It states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cannot change thread mode after it is set. (Exception from HRESULT:\n  0x80010106 (RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE))  at\n  Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.CurrentAppSimulator.RequestProductPurchaseAsync(String\n  productId)  at\n  Crocs_World__Xbox_Edition_.App.d__7.MoveNext()</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's what I'm doing in code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public async Task LoadInAppPurchaseProxyFileAsync()   \n{\n     StorageFolder proxyDataFolder = await Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFolderAsync(\"data\");\n     StorageFile proxyFile = await proxyDataFolder.GetFileAsync(\"in-app-purchase.xml\");\n     licenseChangeHandler = new LicenseChangedEventHandler(InAppPurchaseRefreshScenario);\n     CurrentAppSimulator.LicenseInformation.LicenseChanged += licenseChangeHandler;\n     await CurrentAppSimulator.ReloadSimulatorAsync(proxyFile);\n\n    // setup application upsell message\n    try\n    {\n        ListingInformation listing = await CurrentAppSimulator.LoadListingInformationAsync();\n        var product1 = listing.ProductListings[\"product1\"];\n        var product2 = listing.ProductListings[\"product2\"];               \n    }\n    catch (Exception e)\n    {\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"LoadListingInformationAsync API call failed:\" + e);               \n    }\n}\n\nprivate async void InAppPurchaseRefreshScenario()\n{           \n    Debug.WriteLine(\"InAppPurchaseRefreshScenario\");\n}\n\npublic async Task BuyFeature()\n{\n    LicenseInformation licenseInformation = CurrentAppSimulator.LicenseInformation;\n    if (!licenseInformation.ProductLicenses[\"product2\"].IsActive)\n    {\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Buying Product 2...\");\n        try\n        {\n            await CurrentAppSimulator.RequestProductPurchaseAsync(\"product2\");\n            if (licenseInformation.ProductLicenses[\"product2\"].IsActive)\n            {\n                Debug.WriteLine(\"You bought Product 2.\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Debug.WriteLine(\"Product 2 was not purchased.\");\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Debug.WriteLine(\"Unable to buy Product 2.\" + e);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"You already own Product 2.\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Whenever I call <code>BuyFeature</code> it throws the exception. Except if I call it right in <code>LoadInAppPurchaseProxyFileAsync</code>. Then it seems to be in the same thread I guess.\nIf I replace <code>Task</code> with <code>void</code> in both methods it doesn't work either. It also doesn't matter if I call it from app.xaml.cs or the game.cs.\nDoes anybody have an idea what I'm doing wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n\n<p>Harry </p>\n"
