For reference, we're using Angular4. We get this error when trying to run <code>ng serve</code> in order to run the app locally. The interesting thing is that once we run <code>ng serve</code> and the build fails due to the below error, if we just go into any file and add a new blank line anywhere in the file and save (which automatically re-runs <code>ng serve</code>), then the app will compile successfully (as seen at the bottom of the console output <code>webpack: Compiled successfully.</code> -- that is where we added a new blank line and re-saved):</p>\n\n<pre><code>UserNameHere influx-archiver2 (master) &gt; ng serve\n\n@angular/compiler-cli@4.3.0 requires typescript@'&gt;=2.1.0 &lt;2.4.0' but 2.5.2 was found instead.\nUsing this version can result in undefined behaviour and difficult to debug problems.\n\nPlease run the following command to install a compatible version of TypeScript.\n\nnpm install typescript@'&gt;=2.1.0 &lt;2.4.0'\n\nTo disable this warning run \"ng set warnings.typescriptMismatch=false\".\n\n** NG Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **\nDate: 2018-05-11T17:33:43.081Z\nHash: d5a1d43de98307f01054\nTime: 20633ms\nchunk {inline} inline.bundle.js (inline) 3.85 kB [entry] [rendered]\nchunk {main} main.bundle.js (main) 758 kB [initial] [rendered]\nchunk {polyfills} polyfills.bundle.js (polyfills) 575 kB [initial] [rendered]\nchunk {styles} styles.bundle.js (styles) 735 kB [initial] [rendered]\nchunk {vendor} vendor.bundle.js (vendor) 19.5 MB [initial] [rendered]\n\nERROR in Error: Metadata version mismatch for module /Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/material/core/typings/index.d.ts, found version 4, expected 3, resolving symbol MatModule in /Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/src/app/shared/mat.module.ts, resolving symbol MatModule in /Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/src/app/shared/mat.module.ts\n at Error (native)\n at syntaxError (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler/bundles/compiler.umd.js:1725:34)\n at simplifyInContext (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler/bundles/compiler.umd.js:24950:23)\n at StaticReflector.simplify (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler/bundles/compiler.umd.js:24962:13)\n at StaticReflector.annotations (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler/bundles/compiler.umd.js:24392:41)\n at _getNgModuleMetadata (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_impl.js:138:31)\n at _extractLazyRoutesFromStaticModule (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_impl.js:109:26)\n at /Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_impl.js:129:27\n at Array.reduce (native)\n at _extractLazyRoutesFromStaticModule (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_impl.js:128:10)\n at Object.listLazyRoutesOfModule (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_impl.js:53:22)\n at Function.NgTools_InternalApi_NG_2.listLazyRoutes (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/ngtools_api.js:91:39)\n at AotPlugin._getLazyRoutesFromNgtools (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/plugin.js:240:66)\n at _donePromise.Promise.resolve.then.then.then.then.then (/Users/UserNameHere/Desktop/InfluxArchiver2/influx-archiver2/node_modules/@ngtools/webpack/src/plugin.js:493:24)\n at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7)\n\nwebpack: Failed to compile.\nwebpack: Compiling...\nDate: 2018-05-11T17:33:54.396Z -

            "body": "<p>I have a Python program that sends a high volume of patch requests to the Firebase database REST API for my project, around 5-15k requests every 15 minutes. I first tried to send these simultaneously, putting each call into its own thread, and I got this error repeatedly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exception occurred: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='my-app.firebaseio.com',\n  port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /items/item-id/.json (Caused\n  by\n  NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno\n  8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known',))</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I limit the amount of items so that only ~100 requests happen each interval, there are no problems. One thing I tried was to spread out the requests so they occur over a 60 second span every 15 minutes, but that still didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>The function that gets passed to each thread looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def make_request(self, val):\n        url = \"https://my-project.firebaseio.com/items/\" + self.item_id + \"/.json\"\n        try:\n            self.s.patch(url, json.dumps({\"my-key\": val}), headers=None, timeout=None)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Exception occurred: \" + str(e))\n</code></pre>\n"
