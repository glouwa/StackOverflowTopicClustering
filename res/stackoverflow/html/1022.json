I have another project where building the image and running it is working, where the Dockerfile is set up in the same way, and in those case the ENTRYPOINT is copied correctly. So I think this is the problem, but I haven't found I way to solve it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>\nAfter correcting an error in my Dockerfile, I can exclude that the copying of entrypoints to the image is the problem. However, the error remains: I now get the error \"Could not find or load main class .opt.cartservicejava-swarm.jar\" where before it was only \"Could not find or load main class\". </p>\n\n<p>This is the pom.xml file</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n         xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\"&gt;\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\n\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.cartservicejava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;cartservicejava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;packaging&gt;war&lt;/packaging&gt;\n    &lt;build&gt;\n        &lt;finalName&gt;cartservicejava&lt;/finalName&gt;\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.wildfly.swarm&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;wildfly-swarm-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;${version.wildfly-swarm}&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;executions&gt;\n                    &lt;execution&gt;\n                        &lt;goals&gt;\n                            &lt;goal&gt;package&lt;/goal&gt;\n                        &lt;/goals&gt;\n                    &lt;/execution&gt;\n                &lt;/executions&gt;\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\n        &lt;/plugins&gt;\n    &lt;/build&gt;\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n        &lt;failOnMissingWebXml&gt;false&lt;/failOnMissingWebXml&gt;\n        &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\n        &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\n        &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;\n        &lt;version.wildfly-swarm&gt;2017.7.0&lt;/version.wildfly-swarm&gt;\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javaee-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.wildfly.swarm&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxrs&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;dependencyManagement&gt;\n        &lt;dependencies&gt;\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;javax&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;javaee-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;7.0&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.wildfly.swarm&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;bom-all&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;${version.wildfly-swarm}&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;\n                &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;\n&lt;/project&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the Dockerfile</p>\n\n<pre><code>FROM openjdk:jre-alpine\n\nCOPY target/cartservicejava-swarm.jar /opt/cartservicejava-swarm.jar\n\nEXPOSE 8080\n# preferIPv4Stack is needed to keep wildfly-swarm happy\nENTRYPOINT [\"java\", \"-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\", \"/opt/cartservicejava-swarm.jar\"]\n</code></pre>\n\n\n"
