They go to attack every other building that was there when the level starts, but none of the built ones.</p>\n\n<p>There is a list being set up of the closest targets to units and they will go to attack their closest target, but any newly instantiated buildings or units, don't get attacked for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>The function DecideWhatToDo() is called on all units in the WorldObject script when they are not doing anything. It then calls FindNearbyObjects() from the WorkManager script.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works up until new units and buildings are created, has anyone experienced this kind of problem before?</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.AI;\nusing RTS;\n\npublic class WorldObject : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    BoxCollider boxCollider;\n    bool isDead;\n    bool isSinking;\n\n    public string objectName;\n    public Texture2D buildImage;\n    public int cost, sellValue, maxHitPoints;\n    public float hitPoints;\n    public virtual bool IsActive { get { return true; } }\n    public float weaponRange = 10.0f;\n    public float weaponRechargeTime = 1.0f;\n    public float weaponAimSpeed = 1.0f;\n    public AudioClip attackSound, selectSound, useWeaponSound;\n    public float attackVolume = 1.0f, selectVolume = 1.0f, useWeaponVolume = 1.0f;\n    public int ObjectId { get; set; }\n    public float detectionRange = 20.0f;\n    public GameObject explosionPrefab, splat;\n\n    protected NavMeshAgent agent;\n    protected AudioElement audioElement;\n    protected Animator anim;\n    protected List&lt;WorldObject&gt; nearbyObjects;\n    protected Rect playingArea = new Rect(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    protected Player player;\n    protected string[] actions = { };\n    protected bool currentlySelected = false;\n    protected Bounds selectionBounds;\n    protected GUIStyle healthStyle = new GUIStyle();\n    protected float healthPercentage = 1.0f;\n    protected WorldObject target = null;\n    protected bool attacking = false;\n    protected bool movingIntoPosition = false;\n    protected bool aiming = false;\n\n    private List&lt;Material&gt; oldMaterials = new List&lt;Material&gt;();\n    private float currentWeaponChargeTime;\n    //we want to restrict how many decisions are made to help with game performance\n    //the default time at the moment is a tenth of a second\n    private float timeSinceLastDecision = 0.0f, timeBetweenDecisions = 0.1f;\n\n    protected virtual void Awake()\n    {\n        anim = GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;();\n        boxCollider = GetComponent&lt;BoxCollider&gt;();\n        selectionBounds = ResourceManager.InvalidBounds;\n        CalculateBounds();\n    }\n\n    protected virtual void Start()\n    {\n        agent = GetComponent&lt;NavMeshAgent&gt;();\n        SetPlayer();\n        if (player) SetTeamColor();\n        InitialiseAudio();\n    }\n\n    protected virtual void Update()\n    {\n        if (isSinking)\n        {\n            this.transform.Translate(-Vector3.up * 2.5f * Time.deltaTime);\n        }\n        if (ShouldMakeDecision()) DecideWhatToDo();\n        currentWeaponChargeTime += Time.deltaTime;\n        if (attacking &amp;&amp; !movingIntoPosition &amp;&amp; !aiming)\n        {\n\n            PerformAttack();\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n * A child class should only determine other conditions under which a decision should\n * not be made.
