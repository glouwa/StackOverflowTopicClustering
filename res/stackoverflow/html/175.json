            "body": "<p>I am struggling with coming up with a reasonable solution to formatting my data into an appropriate structure to input into a pyspark dataframe. I am new to pyspark so perhaps I am missing something relatively straight forward. I have a large text file ~500MB which is in the following format</p>\n\n<pre><code>1:\n1488844,3,2005-09-06\n822109,5,2005-05-13\n885013,4,2005-10-19\n30878,4,2005-12-26\n823519,3,2004-05-03\n2:\n1076258,3,2004-06-28\n1663216,2,2004-12-28\n549526,3,2005-05-11\n1850680,1,2005-09-17\n3:\n1307418,4,2005-10-15\n253326,5,2005-04-15\n486798,5,2005-05-27\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to input it into a pyspark dataframe. I started by inputting it into an RDD like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dirPath = 'hdfs://data/movie-data/file.txt'\n\nmovieratings_RDD = sc.textFile(dirPath)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was wondering if there was a more succinct way of extracting out the number colon values and putting them into a separate column like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1,1488844,3,2005-09-06\n1,822109,5,2005-05-13\n1,885013,4,2005-10-19\n1,30878,4,2005-12-26\n1,823519,3,2004-05-03\n2,1076258,3,2004-06-28\n2,1663216,2,2004-12-28\n2,549526,3,2005-05-11\n2,1850680,1,2005-09-17\netc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know that I could just loop through each row and regenerate the columns but I assume there is a more effective way of performing this task. I looked at the function explode but that function applies to the situation when you want to explode a grouped set of values in a column into a column where the grouped values are assigned to their own row.</p>\n"
