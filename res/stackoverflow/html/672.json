When I try to execute a git command I get the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ssh_askpass: exec(rpostback-askpass): No such file or directory\nHost key verification failed.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can run the exact same command on the command prompt and it works.  I can also run the exact same command on the git bash shell and it works.  I am not sure why <code>cmd</code> can't find the key when run from R using the <code>system()</code> command.  Is there a way to specify the key location for the command prompt used by the <code>system()</code> command?  </p>\n\n<p>Update:\nAn example call that won't work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>system(\"git push --set-upstream git@gitlab.mygit.com:MyGroup/testGitlab.git master\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>also</p>\n\n<pre><code>system(\"git clone git@gitlab.mygit.com:MyGroup/gitLabTest.git\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both of these calls get the same error above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> It appears that the ssh keys are not visible from R using <code>list.files()</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; list.files(\"C:/Users/Me/Documents/.ssh/\", all.files = TRUE)\n[1] \".\"  \"..\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have verified that there are multiple ssh keys in this directory which are visible from the git bash shell using <code>ls -a</code>.</p>\n"
