Now Every button has different design.</p>\n\n<p>Query:\n1. click on single button will change path fill color for 5 seconds and then back to previous state. \n2. Outside this group of buttons, I have common button which will change color on all buttons for 5 seconds and back to normal.\n3. I have another common button to cancel color change time. i.e. As soon i click cancel button, it should cancel timer.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=\"ConfigureInstButton\" TargetType=\"Button\"&gt;\n        &lt;Setter Property=\"SnapsToDevicePixels\" Value=\"True\" /&gt;\n        &lt;Setter Property=\"Template\"&gt;\n            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;\n                &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type Button}\"&gt;\n                    &lt;Canvas x:Name=\"cnv\" Width=\"{TemplateBinding ActualWidth}\" Height=\"{TemplateBinding Height}\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Grid Width=\"{Binding ActualWidth, ElementName=cnv}\" Height=\"{Binding ActualHeight, ElementName=cnv}\"&gt;\n                            &lt;Border x:Name=\"borderRect\" Background=\"{TemplateBinding Background}\" BorderThickness=\"0\" BorderBrush=\"{StaticResource solidBrush_LightGray_0.75_darker}\"\n                                    CornerRadius=\"2\"&gt;\n                                &lt;Path x:Name=\"pathInstrumentType\" Tag=\"{TemplateBinding Tag}\" Margin=\"5\"&gt;\n                                    &lt;Path.Style&gt;\n                                        &lt;Style TargetType=\"Path\"&gt;\n                                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Stretch\" Value=\"Uniform\" /&gt;\n                                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Fill\" Value=\"{StaticResource solidBrush_LightGray_0.75_darker}\" /&gt;\n                                        &lt;/Style&gt;\n                                    &lt;/Path.Style&gt;\n                                &lt;/Path&gt;\n                            &lt;/Border&gt;\n                            &lt;Button x:Name=\"LoadingImage\" Tag=\"{TemplateBinding Tag}\" Style=\"{DynamicResource Loading}\" Visibility=\"Collapsed\" Margin=\"0,2,0,0\" /&gt;\n\n                            &lt;Border  x:Name=\"borderConfigure\" BorderThickness=\"1\" BorderBrush=\"{StaticResource solidBrush_LightGray_0.75_darker}\" Visibility=\"Collapsed\" Tag=\"{TemplateBinding Content}\"\n                                    Background=\"{StaticResource solidBrush_Highlight}\" Opacity=\"0.6\" Panel.ZIndex=\"2\" CornerRadius=\"2\"&gt;\n                                &lt;Path x:Name=\"pathConfigure\" Margin=\"5\" Height=\"18\"&gt;\n                                    &lt;Path.Style&gt;\n                                        &lt;Style TargetType=\"Path\"&gt;\n                                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Data\" Value=\"{StaticResource geoData_ConfigureInstrument}\" /&gt;\n                                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Stretch\" Value=\"Uniform\" /&gt;\n                                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Fill\" Value=\"{StaticResource solidBrush_White_0.05_darker}\" /&gt;\n                                        &lt;/Style&gt;\n                                    &lt;/Path.Style&gt;\n                                &lt;/Path&gt;\n                            &lt;/Border&gt;\n                        &lt;/Grid&gt;\n                    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n                    &lt;ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;\n                        &lt;Trigger Property=\"IsMouseOver\" Value=\"True\"&gt;\n                            &lt;Setter TargetName=\"borderConfigure\" Property=\"Visibility\" Value=\"Visible\"/&gt;\n                            &lt;Setter TargetName=\"borderRect\" Property=\"Opacity\" Value=\"0.2\" /&gt;\n                            &lt;Setter Property=\"Cursor\" Value=\"Hand\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;/Trigger&gt;\n\n                    &lt;/ControlTemplate.Triggers&gt;\n                &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;\n            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;\n        &lt;/Setter&gt;\n    &lt;/Style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"
