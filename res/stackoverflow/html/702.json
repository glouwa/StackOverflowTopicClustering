But I don&#39;t want that: my intention is that `self.get_function` should return either a byte copy of the stored value or an error (that&#39;s why I put `.map(|f| *f)`, and `Function` is `Copy`).\r\n\r\nChanging `&amp;&#39;a mut self` to something else doesn&#39;t help.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following snippet, somewhat similar in spirit, is accepted:\r\n\r\n    #[derive(Debug)]\r\n    enum Error {\r\n        StackUnderflow,\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct Context {\r\n        stack: Vec&lt;u32&gt;,\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    impl Context {\r\n        fn pop(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, Error&gt; {\r\n            self.stack.pop().ok_or(Error::StackUnderflow)\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        fn add(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\r\n            let a = try!(self.pop());\r\n            let b = try!(self.pop());\r\n    \r\n            self.stack.push(a + b);\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    fn main() {\r\n        let mut a = Context { stack: vec![1, 2] };\r\n        a.add().unwrap();\r\n        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, a.stack);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m confused. What is the problem with the first snippet? Why doesn&#39;t it happen in the second?\r\n\r\nThe snippets are part of a larger piece of code. In order to provide more context, [this on the Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=e2c360eb91f7e0e459e7&amp;version=stable) shows a more complete example with the faulty code, and [this shows an earlier version without `HashMap`](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=f6152f3411c1effed810&amp;version=stable), which passes the borrow checker and runs normally.\r\n",

But I don't want that: my intention is that <code>self.get_function</code> should return either a byte copy of the stored value or an error (that's why I put <code>.map(|f| *f)</code>, and <code>Function</code> is <code>Copy</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Changing <code>&amp;'a mut self</code> to something else doesn't help.</p>\n\n<p>However, the following snippet, somewhat similar in spirit, is accepted:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#[derive(Debug)]\nenum Error {\n    StackUnderflow,\n}\n\nstruct Context {\n    stack: Vec&lt;u32&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl Context {\n    fn pop(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, Error&gt; {\n        self.stack.pop().ok_or(Error::StackUnderflow)\n    }\n\n    fn add(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        let a = try!(self.pop());\n        let b = try!(self.pop());\n\n        self.stack.push(a + b);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut a = Context { stack: vec![1, 2] };\n    a.add().unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", a.stack);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I'm confused. What is the problem with the first snippet? Why doesn't it happen in the second?</p>\n\n<p>The snippets are part of a larger piece of code. In order to provide more context, <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=e2c360eb91f7e0e459e7&amp;version=stable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this on the Rust Playground</a> shows a more complete example with the faulty code, and <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=f6152f3411c1effed810&amp;version=stable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shows an earlier version without <code>HashMap</code></a>, which passes the borrow checker and runs normally.</p>\n"
