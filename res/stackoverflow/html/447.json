I believe the set_include_path function is causing the errors. </p>\n\n<p>I modified the file paths without any luck. Here is how the .config.inc.php looks like.</p>\n\n<pre><code> set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . 'MarketplaceWebServiceProducts');\n\n     function __autoload($className){\n        $filePath = str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $className) . '.php';\n        $includePaths = explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, get_include_path());\n        foreach($includePaths as $includePath){\n            if(file_exists($includePath . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $filePath)){\n                require_once $filePath;\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried adding <code>dirname(__FILE__)</code> in front of the $filepath variable as well as before the actual folder MarketplaceWebServiceProducts in set_include_path() function. but no luck.</p>\n\n<p>And here is my cron command</p>\n\n<pre><code>php -q /home4/username/example.com/_manager/a/_data_ru/getASINData.php\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The php client library is located in /_data_ru/ folder.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone guide me to the right direction what I need to do to make it work in cron as well?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much.</p>\n"

My machine is running <strong>Windows 7</strong> while the working development is using <strong>Windows 8</strong>. We're developing our Web Application using <strong>Visual Studio 2010</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>First, I got error code <code>0x80070021</code>, similar as posted  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2138285/asp-net-iis-web-config-internal-server-error\">here</a>.\nI update my web.config according to the accepted answer and then I got following error code (which is similar as posted <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10801340/http-error-500-19-internal-server-error\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error\nError Code 0x8007000d\nConfig Source -1: 0:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have read the symptoms definition in <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942055\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Microsoft support page</a> and cause of the error is: </p>\n\n<p><em>This problem occurs because the ApplicationHost.config file or the Web.config file contains a malformed XML element.</em> </p>\n\n<p>and the solution is</p>\n\n<p><em>Delete the malformed XML element from the ApplicationHost.config file or from the Web.config file.</em></p>\n\n<p>However, the web.config that I used is working perfectly in the original development environment.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I have checked and tried so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install ASP.NET by calling aspnet_regiis -i </li>\n<li>Set my application to use different application pool (ASP.NET v4.0, .NET v4, etc)</li>\n<li>ApplicationHost.config file is still using default from Windows 7.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is part of my Web.Config</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;\n    &lt;section name=\"handlers\" overrideModeDefault=\"Allow\" /&gt; \n    &lt;section name=\"modules\" allowDefinition=\"MachineToApplication\" overrideModeDefault=\"Allow\" /&gt;\n    &lt;validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration=\"false\" /&gt;\n    &lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=\"true\"&gt;\n    &lt;/modules&gt;\n    &lt;handlers&gt;\n        &lt;remove name=\"UrlRoutingHandler\" /&gt;\n        &lt;add name=\"ReportViewerWebControlHandler\" preCondition=\"integratedMode\" verb=\"*\" path=\"Reserved.ReportViewerWebControl.axd\" type=\"Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms.HttpHandler, Microsoft.ReportViewer.WebForms, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/handlers&gt;\n    &lt;urlCompression doStaticCompression=\"true\" doDynamicCompression=\"false\"&gt;&lt;/urlCompression&gt;\n    &lt;directoryBrowse enabled=\"true\" /&gt;\n    &lt;defaultDocument&gt;\n        &lt;files&gt;\n            &lt;add value=\"Logon.aspx\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/files&gt;\n    &lt;/defaultDocument&gt;\n&lt;/system.webServer&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have read similar/duplicates/closed posts (around 13) posts in stackoverflow, tried all except the answer related to Ajax (is it related) and still have no clue on what the error is.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone one how to fix this error?
