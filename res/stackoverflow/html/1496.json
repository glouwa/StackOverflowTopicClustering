            "body": "<p>I have found many ways to set pathPatterns to apply to certain directories or files. I need to <strong>EXCLUDE</strong> a directory from a general pattern.</p>\n\n<p>I have an InstantApp intent-filter with a <code>pathPattern=\"/.*\"</code> That allows two ways of passing parameters with the download of the instantapp feature <code>module</code>, <code>viz</code>., <code>example.com/abc/xyz</code> or <code>example.com/?Q1=abc&amp;Q2=xyz</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I need a directory, say, <code>example.com/exclusion</code> NOT to be treated as a parameter to be passed but as <strong>BROWSABLE</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas or am I asking the impossible? BTW I do not want to move my pathPattern to, say, <code>\"/insertion/.*\"</code></p>\n"
