The integers represent the level of circuling rotation of the string. (abcd, 1 -&gt; bcda) My ploblem comes in the main method while reading. Here it is: \r\n\r\n    int main(){\r\n    int k;\r\n    string s;\r\n    while(cin &gt;&gt; m){\r\n\r\n            while(cin &gt;&gt; k){\r\n            string temp = m;\r\n            shift(k);\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            m = temp;\r\n\r\n        } }\r\n\r\nI need to read multiple examples, but this code reads m(the string) only once and k(the level) is read by infinity. How can I make it read m, on the new line array of k-s and then m again? \r\n\r\nHere is the whole program:\r\n\r\n        #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;sstream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    string m;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    void reverse_arr(int a, int b)\r\n    { unsigned i, j, k, c;\r\n      char tmp;\r\n      for (c=(b-a)/2, k=a, j=b, i=0; i&lt;c; i++, j--, k++)\r\n      { tmp = m[k];\r\n        m[k] = m[j];\r\n        m[j] = tmp;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void shift(unsigned k)\r\n    {\r\n        int N = m.length();\r\n        reverse_arr(0, k-1);\r\n        reverse_arr(k, N - 1);\r\n        reverse_arr(0, N - 1);\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        int k;\r\n        string s;\r\n        while(getline(cin,m)){\r\n            string int_line;\r\n            if(getline(cin,int_line)){\r\n                istringstream is(int_line);\r\n                while(is &gt;&gt; k){\r\n                string temp = m;\r\n                shift(k);\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n                m = temp;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n     }\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nP.S.
