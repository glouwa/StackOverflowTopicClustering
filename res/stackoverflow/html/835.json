            "body_markdown": "I have an assignment for my Applied Computer Science class in which we are to test the strength and qualities of an algorithm that tries to find the k:th highest value in a list. This is to be tested both for varying k:s (0, 1, 2, ..., k=N), and varying N:s where I have chosen k=0 and N (1, 2, ..., N). We&#39;re supposed to determine whether the algorithm ever makes more than pi*N comparisons as well as log2(N/2 - k)*N comparisons. \r\n\r\nTo find some clarity in this I made two plots, both having number of comparisons as the y-axis, and k and N respectively for the x-axis. Alongside the plots I want the functions y = pi*N and y = log2(N/2 - k)*N. The problem is I get a ValueError for the second function, most definitely when N/2 = k. I would still like to plot it in python and my question is how to get around this.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the code isn&#39;t really relevant. \r\nMy question is: how can I plot this function while circumventing it&#39;s undefined parts?
