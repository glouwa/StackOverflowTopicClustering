Unfortunately with the code I have, it's not working and I can't figure out why. I think it might be something with the jQuery so I'd like to try and re-write this function using vanilla JS, but I'm not sure how.</p>\n\n<p>It is the last part of the function, the if (empty.length), hide form, show thank you message that is causing me problems. Everything else is working fine, so its this function I would like to try and write in JavaScript, or try another way using jquery to make it work. The problem is it doesn't work in my code, but when I open this in a jsfiddle, it doesnt just hide the form it opens a new page and I get an error.
