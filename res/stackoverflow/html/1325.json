            "body": "<p>Recent,I study Macro as my graduation. I try define a custom annotation (extend scala.annotation.Annotation) and use it in scala case class field.\nIn order to let the annotation in getter method, I use the @meta.getter</p>\n\n<pre><code>package play.swagger.annotation\nimport scala.annotation.Annotation\nfinal class FieldAnnotation(\n  descrip: String\n) extends Annotation\n\ncase class PersonGet(\n@(FieldAnnotation @meta.getter)(descrip=\"人的ID\")\n  id: Long\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I use this case class as a type parameter, and try to get in compile time with macro</p>\n\n<p>first, I try to get the type of this case class named <code>t</code>, it successful, then a get all of it members, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>t.members.collect {\n    case m: MethodSymbol if m.isCaseAccessor =&gt;\n      val des = getActionDescrip(m)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then I try to get every filed FieldAnnotation annotation with flowing code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private def getActionDescrip(m: MethodSymbol):Map[String, Any] = {\n    val ans = m.annotations\n    if(ans.nonEmpty) {\n      val a = ans(0).tree.productElement(1)\n      a match {\n        case l:List[_] =&gt; Map(\"describe\" -&gt; removeStrQuotation(l(0).toString))\n        case _         =&gt; Map(\"describe\" -&gt; \"\")\n      }\n    } else  {\n      Map(\"describe\" -&gt; \"annotation parse fail\")\n    }\n\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then I use some case class to test,but I find some case class annotation information can be obtain, but some is \"annotation parse fail\". Why?</p>\n\n<p>Is macro compile and ordinary code compile order lead it?\nIs macro compile and ordinary code compile is two thread?</p>\n\n<p>Then I try to package it as a jar and put it in Play framework，the problem is exist too</p>\n"
