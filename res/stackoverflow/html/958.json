When I change the passwd, I see the following error sometimes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>root@US16SIQC:~# passwd \nChanging password for root\nNew password: \nBad password: too short\nRetype password: \n\npasswd: can't create '/etc/passwd+': File exists\npasswd: can't update password file /etc/passwd\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These things happen sometimes only. What is the fix for this?</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I change the passwd, it creates passwd+ and passwd- files. I undersatnd that passwd+ file gets copied into passwd file and passwd- is a backup file. So when the first error came, this file still exists.</p>\n\n<p>Please help on this. Thanks in advance!!</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT]: I Fixed the read-only filesystem problem, but still see the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Change passwd (Passwd changed successfully)</li>\n<li>Observe that there is no <code>passwd+</code> file in <code>/etc</code></li>\n<li>Do a hard power reboot</li>\n<li>Observed that <code>passwd+</code> is exists under <code>/etc</code></li>\n<li>Now I cannot change it unless I remove the <code>passwd+</code> file</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This happens only by hard reboot, not by soft reboot.</p>\n\n<p>I am using imx6dl based custom board with eMMC flash containing two partitions-one <code>vfat(zImage and dtb)</code> and other <code>etx4(rootfs)</code>.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>I have a problem with Xamarin.Forms whereby the View is not refreshing as I would expect it to.</p>\n\n<p>I have bound a View to a ViewModel, and I have a series of methods to perform various functions.</p>\n\n<p>On the successful completion of a function, I want it to execute my <code>LoadResults()</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>LoadResults()</code> method works fine when I load the view initially. However, when I execute any other method (<code>DeleteScan(id)</code> method shown below) it should re-fire the LoadResults() method and reload the page.</p>\n\n<p>I know it is entering the <code>LoadResults()</code> method as I've put a break point in there and stepped through it. But by the end of it, it doesn't reload the view.</p>\n\n<p>I also know the view <em>can</em> refresh, as I have other simple methods which are simply updating properties in the VM and those changes are reflecting in the UI.</p>\n\n<p>So for whatever reason, <code>LoadResults()</code> is not reloading the page.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas what I've done wrong here?</p>\n\n<p><strong>View Model Constructor and Properties</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ResultsProcessViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged\n    {\n\n        public ICommand AddTimingCommand { get;

Unfortunately, when I added a listener to track the location of the cursor, the animation slows down significantly every time I move the mouse. If I click, it stops completely. I'm guessing it's too much to process, so is there a way to improve the run time of the animation? Would this work with Web Workers? </p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');\r\ncanvas.width = window.innerWidth;\r\ncanvas.height = window.innerHeight;\r\nvar c = canvas.getContext('2d');\r\n//Variables for the blue ball\r\nvar bx = Math.random() * innerWidth;\r\nvar by = Math.random() * innerHeight;\r\nvar bbdx = 1;\r\nvar bbdy = 1;\r\nvar bRadius = 12;\r\n//Variables for the red balls\r\nvar rx = Math.random() * innerWidth;\r\nvar ry = Math.random() * innerHeight;\r\nvar rrdx = 1;\r\nvar rrdy = 1;\r\nvar rRadius = 12;\r\n//Mouse coordinate object\r\nvar mouse = {\r\n  x: undefined,\r\n  y: undefined\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction bCircle() {\r\n  c.beginPath();\r\n  c.arc(bx, by, bRadius, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);\r\n  c.strokeStyle = \"white\";\r\n  c.stroke();\r\n  c.fillStyle = \"cornflowerblue\";\r\n  c.fill();\r\n  c.closePath();\r\n\r\n  //Ball bouncing Conditional\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction rCircle() {\r\n  c.beginPath();\r\n  c.arc(rx, ry, rRadius, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);\r\n  c.strokeStyle = \"pink\";\r\n  c.stroke();\r\n  c.fillStyle = \"red\";\r\n  c.fill();\r\n  c.closePath();\r\n  //Ball Bouncing Conditional\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Interactivity function\r\nfunction bClick() {\r\n  window.addEventListener('mousemove', function(event) {\r\n    mouse.x = event.x;\r\n    mouse.y = event.y;\r\n    console.log(mouse);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction draw() {\r\n  c.clearRect(0, 0, innerWidth, innerHeight);\r\n  bCircle();\r\n  rCircle();\r\n\r\n  //bCircle Conditional\r\n  if (bx + bRadius &gt; innerWidth || bx - bRadius &lt; 0) {\r\n    bbdx = -bbdx;\r\n  }\r\n  //Conditional to mall the ball bounce up and down\r\n  if (by + bRadius &gt; innerHeight || by - bRadius &lt; 0) {\r\n    bbdy = -bbdy;\r\n  }\r\n  //Add 1 to x continously for it to move\r\n  bx += bbdx;\r\n  //Add 1 constantly to y for it to move up and down also\r\n  by += bbdy;\r\n\r\n  //rCircle Conditional\r\n  if (rx + rRadius &gt; innerWidth || rx - rRadius &lt; 0) {\r\n    rrdx = -rrdx;\r\n  }\r\n  if (ry + rRadius &gt; innerHeight || ry - rRadius &lt; 0) {\r\n    rrdy = -rrdy;\r\n  }\r\n  rx += rrdx;\r\n  ry += rrdy;\r\n\r\n  bClick();\r\n}\r\n\r\nsetInterval(function() {\r\n  draw();\r\n}, 8);</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;title&gt;Tap-Tap&lt;/title&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\n    canvas {\r\n      border: 1px solid black;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    body {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      background-color: black;\r\n    }\r\n  &lt;/style&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;canvas&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;script src=\"ball.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n"
