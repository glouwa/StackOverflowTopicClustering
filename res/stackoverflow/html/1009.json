My intention is if combobox1 = Celsius, and combobox2 = Fahrenheit, then use this calculation and output to textField_1 as a Fahrenheit value. Could you help me explicitly how to do this please?  Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!  I have tried searching for something similar, but I couldn't find one that is like mine, and others used netbeans and were quite different.    </p>\n\n<pre><code>        JButton btnNewButton = new JButton(\"Convert\");//converts temperature input to output based on the comboBox and comboBox1 selections. \n    btnNewButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {\n\n\n            String inputTemp = (String)comboBox.getSelectedItem();\n            String inputTemp1 = (String)comboBox_1.getSelectedItem();\n\n            double inputTemp, inputTemp1, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin;\n            inputTemp=Double.parseDouble(textField.getText());\n\n            if (inputTemp.equals(\"Celsius\") &amp;&amp; inputTemp1.equals(\"Fahrenheit\")) {\n                Celsius = inputTemp;\n            Fahrenheit = (Celsius*1.8)+32;\n            textField_1.setText(Double.toString(Fahrenheit));\n\n        }else{JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \"Invalid value.\");\n            }\n\n        }\n    });\n    btnNewButton.setFont(new Font(\"Times New Roman\", Font.PLAIN, 13));\n    btnNewButton.setBounds(335, 64, 89, 103);\n    frame.getContentPane().add(btnNewButton);\n\n    textField_1 = new JTextField();\n    textField_1.setBounds(41, 129, 147, 38);\n    frame.getContentPane().add(textField_1);\n    textField_1.setColumns(10);\n\n    JComboBox comboBox = new JComboBox();\n    comboBox.setBounds(198, 67, 127, 38);\n    frame.getContentPane().add(comboBox);\n\n    comboBox.addItem(\"Celsius\");\n    comboBox.addItem(\"Fahrenheit\");\n    comboBox.addItem(\"Kelvin\");\n\n    JComboBox comboBox_1 = new JComboBox();\n    comboBox_1.setBounds(198, 129, 127, 38);\n    frame.getContentPane().add(comboBox_1);\n\n    comboBox_1.addItem(\"Celsius\");\n    comboBox_1.addItem(\"Fahrenheit\");\n    comboBox_1.addItem(\"Kelvin\");\n</code></pre>\n"

            "body_markdown": "Creating a WCF Service Library in Visual Studio 2008 on Vista x64 is troublesome when referencing an x86 DLL. A service that calls a 32-bit DLL is required to have a platform target of x86 to run on a 64-bit OS. When you do this, the WcfSvcHost throws a BadImageFormatException when you attempt to debug the service. There is a [bug report][1] on MS connect. The workaround I used was to [coreflag WcfSvcHost as 32-bit][2].\r\n\r\n**Manifest Problem**\r\n\r\nThe main issue I&#39;ve run in to is this third-party native 32-bit DLL fails to load using certain WCF hosts. I receive the following error when **a service operation is invoked** that uses the third-party DLL:\r\n\r\n&gt; System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for\r\n&gt; &#39;&lt;Module&gt;&#39; threw an exception.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;CrtImplementationDetails&gt;.ModuleLoadExceptionHandlerException: \r\n&gt; A nested exception occurred after the\r\n&gt; primary exception that caused the C++\r\n&gt; module to fail to load.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; System.BadImageFormatException: The module was expected to contain an\r\n&gt; assembly manifest. (Exception from\r\n&gt; HRESULT: 0x80131018)\r\n\r\nNestedException:\r\n&gt; The handle is invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070006 (E_HANDLE))\r\n\r\nThis exception is not raised when WcfSvcHost starts, it&#39;s raised when the a service operation is invoked that references the 32-bit DLL. What&#39;s very interesting, hosting this same service with the same app.config on a console app has no exceptions and works perfectly:\r\n\r\n    using (ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost (typeof (MsgBrokerService))) {\r\n        host.Open ();\r\n        Console.WriteLine (&quot;running&quot;);\r\n        Console.ReadLine ();\r\n\r\nThis exception occurs right after:\r\n\r\n&gt; &#39;WcfSvcHost.exe&#39; (Managed): Loaded\r\n&gt; &#39;C:\\Windows\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft.vc80.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.3053_\r\n&gt; none_d08d7bba442a9b36\\msvcm80.dll&#39;\r\n\r\nAgain, the console app does not have an exception and loads the same DLL:\r\n\r\n&gt; &#39;ConsoleApp.vshost.exe&#39; (Managed):\r\n&gt; Loaded\r\n&gt; &#39;C:\\Windows\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft.vc80.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.3053_\r\n&gt; none_d08d7bba442a9b36\\msvcm80.dll&#39;\r\n\r\n**See answer** [from Microsoft Product Support][3].\r\n\r\nUpdate #1: Both the console application and the WcfSvcHost.exe host process runs under the same session and logged-in user (me). I&#39;ve copied WcfSvcHost.exe to the directory of the service, manually launched and experienced the same result.
