So just call it &quot;X.1&quot; and be done\r\n&gt; with it.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **The insane thing.** \r\n\r\n&gt; You really want to call the new version &quot;X&quot; too,\r\n&gt; even though others have already seen the old one. So just use git tag\r\n&gt; -f again, as if you hadn’t already published the old one.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; However, Git does not (and it should not) change tags behind users\r\n&gt; back. So if somebody already got the old tag, doing a git pull on your\r\n&gt; tree shouldn’t just make them overwrite the old one.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If somebody got a release tag from you, you cannot just change the tag\r\n&gt; for them by updating your own one. This is a big security issue, in\r\n&gt; that people MUST be able to trust their tag-names. If you really want\r\n&gt; to do the insane thing, you need to just fess up to it, and tell\r\n&gt; people that you messed up.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I followed this completely. \r\n\r\n **Q)** In sane thing what does he mean by - ` if you keep the same name, you may be in the situation that two people both have &quot;version X&quot;, but they actually have different &quot;X&quot;&#39;s. So just call it &quot;X.1&quot; and be done with it.`\r\n\r\nIn insane thing , it is written that if I keep the tag name same and force push , git pull won&#39;t update my coworkers having that old tag. Hence  what does he mean by - `you may be in the situation ....` .
