            "body": "<p>Java, Spring JDBC v3.0.5</p>\n\n<p>I defined a DTO which has among others a property of type of custom enum.\nWhen sending it as parameters to a stored procedure call via a <em>BeanPropertySqlParameterSource</em> object, all other properties (that are \"normal\" types, like: Long, String and Boolean) work fine, except the enum type. It throws:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Invalid conversion requested\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Looking into the <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/3.0.x/org.springframework.jdbc/src/main/java/org/springframework/jdbc/core/StatementCreatorUtils.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">StatementCreatorUtils.java</a> method <em>setValue()</em> I see that it does not handle Types.CHAR which is the sqlType of the enum object (I know this from debugging - that is actually the declared type of the parameter in the SQL procedure).</p>\n\n<p>Reading the same DTO (by another procedure) via a <em>BeanPropertyRowMapper</em> works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Is this some bug or omission in Spring code?</p>\n\n<p>The DTO looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyDTO extends Serializable {\n    private Long num;\n    private Boolean bool;\n    private String str;\n\n    public static enum MyEnum { A , B }\n    private MyEnum en;\n    // getters and setters omitted \n}\n\n// the call:\nnew SimpleJdbcCall(m_dataSource).withProcedureName(\"procedureName\").withSchemaName(\"schema\").executeObject(BigDecimal.class, new BeanPropertySqlParameterSource(aMyDTO)).longValue();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>I worked the problem around</strong> by making <em>MyEnum</em> implement the <em>java.lang.CharSequence</em> interface, so the <em>isStringValue()</em> method in the <em>StatementCreatorUtils</em> class \"thinks\" it is a string and calls:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ps.setString(paramIndex, inValue.toString());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is the same line as a few lines above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    else if (sqlType == Types.VARCHAR || sqlType == Types.LONGVARCHAR ||\n            (sqlType == Types.CLOB &amp;&amp; isStringValue(inValue.getClass()))) {\n        ps.setString(paramIndex, inValue.toString());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is skipped since it does not allow the CHAR sqlType.</p>\n\n<p>The database used is Oracle and the actual exception is thrown from the Oracle driver, so it has a similar problem (can't convert from enum to String).\nThe procedure parameter is defined as \"IN CHAR\".</p>\n\n<p>The exception thrown is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Invalid conversion requested\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.setObjectCritical(OraclePreparedStatement.java:13780)\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.setObjectInternal(OraclePreparedStatement.java:13682)\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.setObjectInternal(OraclePreparedStatement.java:14515)\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleCallableStatement.setObject(OracleCallableStatement.java:10918)\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatementWrapper.setObject(OraclePreparedStatementWrapper.java:735)\nat org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setValue(StatementCreatorUtils.java:356)\nat org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setParameterValueInternal(StatementCreatorUtils.java:216)\nat org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setParameterValue(StatementCreatorUtils.java:127)\nat org.springframework.jdbc.core.CallableStatementCreatorFactory$CallableStatementCreatorImpl.createCallableStatement(CallableStatementCreatorFactory.java:212)\nat org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.execute(JdbcTemplate.java:947)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Edit:</em></p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/data/84770-insert-with-enum-s-on-both-ends\" rel=\"nofollow\">another workaround</a> in the Spring forum:</p>\n\n<pre><code>paramSource.registerSqlType(\"en\", Types.VARCHAR);\n</code></pre>\n"
