There is a function to return True if the block at the current (x, y, z) coordinate is part of a mountain. If a block is far away from the centre of a mountain, True is only returned if if the z coord is below a maximum height for the distance from the mountain, ie the further from a mountain a block is, the lower the maximum height. So at the centre of a mountain, the maximum height is high, and True will be returned even if the z is high (I am using a z-up system).

            "body_markdown": "We have a computer that is shared by a number of users (it&#39;s a spare laptop for use when/if their personal device goes down). For most users, Harmon.ie is not accepting the users&#39; custom credentials to access the site, even though these are correct, and do work in Harmon.ie on their own computer. Weirdly, for some users on this shared device, Harmon.ie still works fine. It doesn&#39;t work for most, but does for a couple of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the user fires up Outlook, the Harmon.ie sidebar thinks for a while, then pops up the &#39;Edit SharePoint Site&#39; box. The Username is already present under &#39;Use Custom Credentials&#39;, but the password is blank. Entering the (valid) password brings up the &#39;Test connection&#39; box, which tries to connect for a while, then returns the error &quot;Failed to connect&quot;. An option here is to &#39;Send Report&#39; to Harmon.ie, which I have done. Often, some time later, an auto-generated email is received, and part of the text says &quot;Following a recent change in Office 365 authentication (especially for client applications), you could not use custom credentials. A fix is available for customers at:...&quot; and then provides links for 32- and 64-bit patches. Running this however makes no difference - the problem persists.\r\n\r\nIn general, uninstalling and reinstalling Harmon.ie seems to make no difference where certain users are having the issue, but not others (as is the case here).

            "body": "<p>We have a computer that is shared by a number of users (it's a spare laptop for use when/if their personal device goes down). For most users, Harmon.ie is not accepting the users' custom credentials to access the site, even though these are correct, and do work in Harmon.ie on their own computer. Weirdly, for some users on this shared device, Harmon.ie still works fine. It doesn't work for most, but does for a couple of them.</p>\n\n<p>When the user fires up Outlook, the Harmon.ie sidebar thinks for a while, then pops up the 'Edit SharePoint Site' box. The Username is already present under 'Use Custom Credentials', but the password is blank. Entering the (valid) password brings up the 'Test connection' box, which tries to connect for a while, then returns the error \"Failed to connect\". An option here is to 'Send Report' to Harmon.ie, which I have done. Often, some time later, an auto-generated email is received, and part of the text says \"Following a recent change in Office 365 authentication (especially for client applications), you could not use custom credentials. A fix is available for customers at:...\" and then provides links for 32- and 64-bit patches.
