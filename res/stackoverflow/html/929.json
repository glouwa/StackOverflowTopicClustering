            "body": "<p>I recently came across this app - <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azefsw.purchasedapps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purchase Apps</a>, which is somehow able to retrieve apps I've paid for in google play after I signed in using my google account. </p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to find out how it is being done as I want to build a similar app, but for the free apps which were downloaded. </p>\n\n<p>However, I cant find which OAuth API Scope was used for retrieving that information. I went through the entire list of APIs <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cc8qKl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cc8qKl.jpg\" alt=\"Google Sign in asking for access to androidmarket\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Please help. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI'm putting a new bounty on this question, as suggested by a similar question I've asked about <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/49620194/878126\"><strong>here</strong></a>, and because here and there I don't see a real answer about how to do it, and what can be done with it.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to refine the questions into multiple pieces:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is the API that can be used to get information of purchased apps? Where can I read about it? Please show a full, working example of how to do it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can it do more ? Maybe perform search? Maybe show free apps that were installed? Maybe the time they were installed and uninstalled? And the categories of those apps?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there any special requirements for using this API ?</p></li>\n</ol>\n"
