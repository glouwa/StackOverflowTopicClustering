I want to make an optional library which can be added to the project and would work with the original main library to give Rx support as I do not want to increase the original library's method count. This is similar to how you can add optional Gson support to Retrofit and Retrofit can work with Gson.

            "body": "<p>I came across intriguing case, where I have to connect to a web service in two different ways, based on consumer preference. For the purpose of this question, I would prefer not to mention any products, let's say it is a web service called 'Service' and can be accessed by RestAPI and message broker.</p>\n\n<p>My simplified code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import configparser\nimport os\n\nfrom MyApp.Exceptions import WrongModeException\n\nclass Service(object):\n    cfg_file = 'path/to/cfg.ini'\n    config = configparser.ConfigParser()\n    config.read(cfg_file)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def generate_password():\n        return 'ToPsEcReTp4ssw0rD'\n\nclass ServiceAPI(Service):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.connection = APIConnect(self.config.some_param)\n\n    def do_stuff(self, a):\n        self.connection.do_stuff(a=a)\n\nclass ServiceMessageBroker(Service):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.connection = MessageBrokerConnect(self.config.some_param)\n\n    def do_stuff(self, a):\n        self.connection.do_stuff(a=a)\n\nclass ServiceWrapper(Service):\n    def __init__(self):\n        mode = self.config.get(option='mode')\n\n        if mode == 'Message Broker':\n            self.service = ServiceMessageBroker()\n        elif mode == 'API':\n            self.service = ServiceAPI()\n        else:\n            raise WrongModeException\n            os.sys.exit(1)\n\n    def do_stuff(self, **kwargs):\n        self.service.do_stuff(**kwargs)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    s = ServiceWrapper()\n    s.do_stuff(a='blabla')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a better and cleaner way to do it? I was thinking about mapping appropriate functions in a dictionary and then use it to execute, but seems super ugly to me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"
