I’m not a programmer (I know something about Python).\r\n 2. The game I will describe is an example and I&#39;m actually more interested in understanding how to use a standard approach with ML that is as independent as possible from the game or problem I want to solve (if it is possible).\r\n\r\nLet’s start.\r\n\r\nThe game is described as follow:\r\n\r\n 1. We have a rectangle LxH (L can be equal to H) and inside it there are two players, A and B (they are two pixels or two little graphical circles).\r\n 2. Player A must be moved from starting position (random) to end position and the end position is the rectangle border closer to A such that player B is, at the beginning of the match, between player A and that border.\r\n 3. Player B must be moved from starting position (random) to end position and the end position is the position of player A.\r\n 4. If player A reach the border of the rectangle (see point 2) without being touched by player B, A wins and B loses.\r\n 5. If player B touches player A before A reaches the border of the rectangle (see point 2), A loses and B wins.\r\n\r\nA single round/match of the game is defined as a set of movements performed by players A and B from the starting position (random) to the end position (for player A the border described at point 2, for player B the same position of player A). A simulation is defined as a set of matches from which AI can improve itself and learn more and more on how to move better player A and player B in order to obtain the win of A or B in less time.\r\n\r\nWell, I’d like to simulate this simple game with a Machine Learning approach in order to:\r\n\r\n a. Start the game, at first time, with a full random choice of the next position for players A and B: as result, I’d see a chaotic movements of A and B without any sense.\r\n\r\n b. The algorithm, after some matches, should learn something from previous matches in order to move player A mainly to the win border and player B mainly to player A.\r\n\r\n c. After a sufficient number of matches, that is after a simulation, I’d like to have a set of rules created by AI (a table of best position values for each situation, for example) that can be used to play the game when player B is moved by user and not by algorithm/computer (only player A is moved by computer with the just created AI from the previous completed simulation).\r\n\r\nFor example, I can’t think anything that could help me about point b. Maybe I could use a time constraint that is: if after some time player A or player B has not turned away for more than X pixels from its own starting position, then give a bigger weight to the win border direction for player A and a bigger weight to the direction of player A for player B when choosing the new position for both during a single match. But in this case it would be a forcing action added by programmer, not a real improvement of artificial intelligence coming from the simple rules of the game. Or not?\r\n\r\nSo finally, can you kindly help me understand how to deal with the problem I described (reasoning, mental approaches, python tools, libraries, existing examples code similar to my problem, etc..)?\r\n\r\nThanks for any replies that will help me understand something more about ML starting from a practical problem.\r\n\r\nMatteo\r\n\r\n",
