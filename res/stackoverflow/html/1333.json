            "body": "<p>A couple of years ago I implemented push notification with service worker on a project I was working on, by registering an app on Firebase, and using the registration number as part of the manifest.json file on the server side app. In that case I requested the user to allow notifications, got the browser registration once, saved on server side, and all works fine.</p>\n\n<p>I'm now trying to implement a similar solution, but using the VAPID (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications#using_vapid\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications#using_vapid</a>).\nBrowser registers correctly, sends the registration to the server side app, and the app is able to send push notifications.\nThe issue I got is that after at least 24 hours, when I try to send a push notification to an already registered subscription, I get InvalidSubscription response (410 NotRegistered).\nUsing VAPID, does the browser registration expire after a few hours? do I need to get new registration every certain amount of hours? If yes, how? For example, if user never revisits the site within a day or so, how am I able to keep sending them notifications? I can't find any clear reference for this issue I'm experiencing.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the JS code I use within the SW to get the browser registration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function postPushReg(sub){\n  var rawKey = sub.getKey ? sub.getKey('p256dh') : '';\n  var key = rawKey ?\n        btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(rawKey))) :\n        '';\n  var rawAuthSecret = sub.getKey ? sub.getKey('auth') : '';\n  var authSecret = rawAuthSecret ?\n                   btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(rawAuthSecret))) :\n                   '';\n  fetch('https://XXXXX', {\n    method: 'post',\n    headers: {'Content-type': 'application/json'},\n    body: JSON.stringify({endpoint: sub.endpoint, key: key, authSecret: authSecret}),\n  });\n}\n\nself.addEventListener('install', function(event){\n  self.registration.pushManager.getSubscription()\n  .then(function(sub){\n    if (sub) return postPushReg(sub);\n    return self.registration.pushManager.subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true,\n                                    applicationServerKey: urlB64ToUint8Array('XXX')})\n                                    .then(function(sub){\n                                      postPushReg(sub);\n                                    });\n  });\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('push', function(e){\n  ...\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the Rails/Ruby server side gem (webpush) I use to send the notification:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Webpush.payload_send(\n        message: \"msg\",\n        endpoint: j['endpoint'],\n        p256dh: j['key'],\n        auth: j['authSecret'],\n        vapid: {\n          subject: \"mailto:XXXX\",\n          public_key: \"XXX\",\n          private_key: \"XXX\",\n        }\n      )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, within the first few hours everything works, then I get 410 NotRegistered response.</p>\n"
