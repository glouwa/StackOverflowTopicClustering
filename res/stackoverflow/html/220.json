            "body_markdown": "I am having trouble installing gtk to start building GUIs in C++ on Code::Blocks. Could anyone nudge me in the right direction? I&#39;m running Windows 10 (64-bit) on a Lenovo. \r\n\r\nI attempted an installation guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvQXvTtSIQo), stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32662215/how-do-you-install-gtk-3-0-on-windows), the official GTK installation guide (https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php), a written guide (http://www.tarnyko.net/repo/gtk3_build_system/tutorial/gtk3_tutorial.htm), and just noticed a very similar stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37737020/install-gtk-for-c-on-windows-10) \r\n\r\nBefore this, my PATH environment variable only recorded C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps;C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm;C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin;%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps;\r\n\r\nI downloaded MinGW from mingw.org. This was to the youtube link&#39;s comment that the official is more stable than the one that can be installed with Code::Blocks. I added C:\\MinGW\\bin to PATH. \r\n\r\nTrying the official GTK installation site, I downloaded MSYS2 and used pacman -Syu to install core system packages and pacman -Su to then update. That&#39;s the end of that, so I think gtk is officially installed, I just need to get it to talk to Code::Blocks. I added C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin to PATH but that didn&#39;t seem to work. \r\n\r\nI tried to install the all-in-one bundle for GTK 3.6.4 at http://www.tarnyko.net/dl/gtk.htm , and extracted it to C:\\gtk. I now have C:\\gtk\\bin in PATH. GTK should be in my path in one form or the other. I can run gtk3-demo and gtk-demo-application from CMD but not MSYS2. I&#39;m a bit confused about that. It probably has something to do with MSYS2&#39;s specific path variable, I think? But it should search the system&#39;s PATH afterward? And I don&#39;t know how to change that specific path? Probably questions for another day. \r\n\r\nSo the similar stack overflow, youtube, and written tutorial all say to use pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 to check for a reasonable output to see if I have gtk correctly installed. I installed \r\npkg-config-lite to avoid the glib circular dependency issue that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1710922/how-to-install-pkg-config-in-windows describes and frankly I do not understand. I added it to C:\\MinGW\\bin to by in my path. Now I am able to run it, but get:\r\n\r\n    Package gtk+-3.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.\r\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-3.0.pc&#39;\r\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\r\n    No package &#39;gtk+-3.0&#39; found\r\n\r\nI tried 3.6.4 instead of 3.0. No dice. I tried just 3. Nope. I can only find gtk3 files, and not the actual version I installed anywhere. pkg-config --cflags --libs says that I need to name a library, so I tried just gtk hopiing to get libraries containing that. Nope. The rest of the tutorials are aimed at getting Code::Blocks compiler (I think) to include gtk. I hope this is the only obstacle, and I will be able to get the rest. But, if anyone can help me through the rest, it would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nAt this point I&#39;m out of ideas. Can someone help me?\r\n\r\nGratefully,\r\nJohn\r\n",

The top voted answer there suggests the function \r\n\r\n    is.wholeNumber &lt;- function(x) ( x %% 1 ) == 0\r\n\r\nwhich again does not appear to work in my context, since I get\r\n\r\n    &gt; (45 * 1.4 ) %% 1\r\n    [1] 1\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe second most upvoted post suggests using\r\n\r\n    is.wholeNumber &lt;- function(x) all.equal(x, as.integer(x))\r\n\r\nand whilst once again this does not work, it does give the illuminatingly unexpected output of\r\n\r\n    &gt; is.wholeNumber( 45 * 1.4)\r\n    [1] &quot;Mean relative difference: 0.01587302&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI have now tried this in both a clean R studio workspace, and from R terminal (R 3.4.2 Short Summer) and duplicated this issue. I&#39;d be interested to know:\r\n\r\n 1. Can people reproduce this issue on their machines?\r\n 2. Why I am getting this counter intuitive result?\r\n 3. What is a correct way to work around this?",

            "body": "<p>I wrote a (potentially not particularly good!) function to test if a number is a whole number or not:</p>\n\n<pre><code>is.wholeNumber &lt;- function(x) x == floor(x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general this function works fine for my purpose as I am really only considering cases where I'm testing numbers with a handful of deciminal places, so my naive understanding was that machine precision shouldn't be a factor.</p>\n\n<p>When I apply this function in the case 45 x 1.4 = 63, however I get</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; is.wholeNumber( 45 * 1.4)\n[1] FALSE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This appears to occur because the floor function of R is not evaluating as I would expect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; floor(45 * 1.4)\n[1] 62\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which should in fact be 63. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On doing some reading I came across <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3476782/check-if-the-number-is-integer\">this</a> popular post about how to code this in R. The top voted answer there suggests the function </p>\n\n<pre><code>is.wholeNumber &lt;- function(x) ( x %% 1 ) == 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which again does not appear to work in my context, since I get</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; (45 * 1.4 ) %% 1\n[1] 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The second most upvoted post suggests using</p>\n\n<pre><code>is.wholeNumber &lt;- function(x) all.equal(x, as.integer(x))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and whilst once again this does not work, it does give the illuminatingly unexpected output of</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; is.wholeNumber( 45 * 1.4)\n[1] \"Mean relative difference: 0.01587302\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have now tried this in both a clean R studio workspace, and from R terminal (R 3.4.2 Short Summer) and duplicated this issue. I'd be interested to know:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Can people reproduce this issue on their machines?</li>\n<li>Why I am getting this counter intuitive result?</li>\n<li>What is a correct way to work around this?</li>\n</ol>\n"
