I expect for 10 possible outcomes that random guessing would get me a loss of around `-ln(1/10)~2.3`, certainly 100 is way too high. I also expect that even though I fed the network random arrays that it would eventually memorize those arrays and over-fit and the loss would decrease, but that&#39;s not the case. The loss stays around 100. I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going wrong...\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Some more debugging. I&#39;ve beaten the model into a much simpler one by forcing the inputs and outputs to have the same length. This is not too bad for a spell corrector as long as the spelling mistakes aren&#39;t deleting or inserting too many characters (I pad the sequences anyways to make them the same length which allows me to be able to train on batches). However, the model still exhibits the same behavior. I&#39;ve also tried running the model on random numbers and get the same 100ish loss:\r\n\r\n        num_chars=10\r\n        alpha = 0.001\r\n\r\n        X = np.random.randint(10,size=(10000,30,10))\r\n        Y = np.random.randint(10,size=(10000,30,10))\r\n\r\n        inputs = Input(shape=(None,num_chars))\r\n        x = LSTM(128,return_sequences=True)(inputs)\r\n        x = LSTM(128,return_sequences=True)(x)\r\n        output = Dense(num_chars,activation=&#39;softmax&#39;)(x)\r\n\r\n        model = keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs,outputs=output)\r\n        optim = keras.optimizers.rmsprop(lr=alpha,decay=1e-6)\r\n        model.compile(optimizer=optim,loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;)\r\n        model.summary()\r\n        model.fit(X,Y) \r\n\r\nI&#39;m beginning to wonder if there&#39;s something wrong with my installation of keras or something like that.

I didn&#39;t turn the random Y array into a one-hot vector. When I do change it to a one-hot vector, the loss is as expected, about `-ln(1/num_chars)`. This means that the problem is probably in my tokenizer generator.
