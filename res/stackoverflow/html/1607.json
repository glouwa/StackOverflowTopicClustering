But I&#39;m not sure how to proceed now. From what I could find, the only way to access the inside parts of SVG is through javascript, which I&#39;ve never done before as I don&#39;t know javascript.\r\n\r\nSo I have this\r\n\r\n    &lt;object id=&quot;svg1&quot; data=&quot;path.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m trying to figure out how to access the path inside the SVG.\r\n\r\nI tried putting in this code that I found, but it didn&#39;t do anything.\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    \twindow.onload=function() {\r\n    \tvar a = document.getElementById(&quot;svg1&quot;);\r\n    \tvar svgDoc = a.contentDocument;\r\n    \tvar svgItem = svgDoc.getElementById(&quot;path5076&quot;);\r\n    \tsvgItem.setAttribute(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;lime&quot;);\r\n    };\r\n    \t&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nI then found someone saying that I had to let the SVG load first, so I added\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    \tvar mySVG = document.getElementById(&quot;svg1&quot;);\r\n     var svgDoc;\r\n     mySVG.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;,function() {\r\n          svgDoc = mySVG.contentDocument;\r\n          alert(&quot;SVG contentDocument Loaded!&quot;);\r\n     }, false);\r\n    \t&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nbut that also didn&#39;t seem to work.\r\n\r\nThis is my first stab at JS, so any help is appreciated.\r\nBut if you know how this can be done with CSS **PLEASE** let me know, I&#39;m much more comfortable with it (as comfortable as I can be after two weeks of learning it, as opposed to 0 weeks with JS)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEdited as per suggestion, but I think I&#39;m still doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, I only left `&quot;fill:none;fill-opacity:1;stroke:#febc00;stroke-width:10.80000019&quot;` in `style` and removed everything else. Does that mean I can still assign attributes like `stroke-dasharray` or do they have to be predefined inside `style` first?\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVY78.jpg",

But I'm not sure how to proceed now. From what I could find, the only way to access the inside parts of SVG is through javascript, which I've never done before as I don't know javascript.</p>\n\n<p>So I have this</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;object id=\"svg1\" data=\"path.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I'm trying to figure out how to access the path inside the SVG.</p>\n\n<p>I tried putting in this code that I found, but it didn't do anything.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    window.onload=function() {\n    var a = document.getElementById(\"svg1\");\n    var svgDoc = a.contentDocument;\n    var svgItem = svgDoc.getElementById(\"path5076\");\n    svgItem.setAttribute(\"fill\", \"lime\");\n};\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then found someone saying that I had to let the SVG load first, so I added</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    var mySVG = document.getElementById(\"svg1\");\n var svgDoc;\n mySVG.addEventListener(\"load\",function() {\n      svgDoc = mySVG.contentDocument;\n      alert(\"SVG contentDocument Loaded!\");\n }, false);\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but that also didn't seem to work.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first stab at JS, so any help is appreciated.\nBut if you know how this can be done with CSS <strong>PLEASE</strong> let me know, I'm much more comfortable with it (as comfortable as I can be after two weeks of learning it, as opposed to 0 weeks with JS)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edited as per suggestion, but I think I'm still doing it wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I only left <code>\"fill:none;fill-opacity:1;stroke:#febc00;stroke-width:10.80000019\"</code> in <code>style</code> and removed everything else. Does that mean I can still assign attributes like <code>stroke-dasharray</code> or do they have to be predefined inside <code>style</code> first?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVY78.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVY78.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"

            "body": "<p>Background: I'm just getting started with scikit-learn, and read at the bottom of the page about <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">joblib, versus pickle</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it may be more interesting to use joblib’s replacement of pickle (joblib.dump &amp; joblib.load), which is more efficient on big data, but can only pickle to the disk and not to a string</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read this Q&amp;A on Pickle, \n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3438675/common-use-of-pickle-in-python\">Common use-cases for pickle in Python</a> and wonder if the community here can share the differences between joblib and pickle?  When should one use one over another? </p>\n"
