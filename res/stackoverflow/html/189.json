The Opendaylight can communicate with my other switches including an SBC running an Open vSwitch, a mininet, Zodiac FX SDN switches, and a Pica8 Switch, but strangely, not with the mentioned HP SDN switch.\r\n\r\nI decided to try the HP switch with Opendaylight Hydrogen (the first one), and it worked just fine (though it forced the controller to communicate with OpenFlow 1.0). But I seemed can&#39;t make it work with Opendaylight version other than hydrogen (I tried with Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen).\r\n\r\nHow can I connect that switch, is there anything that I should do before I enable Openflow? Any hints or helps will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHere is the TCP dump of my controller\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\r\n    05:40:22.762385 IP 10.10.5.91.61524 &gt;

            "body": "<p>My lab recently procure an HP (Aruba) 2920 24G and I was told to test it out on an OpenDaylight controller. </p>\n\n<p>First, I setup the OpenDaylight Carbon (0.7.2) with dlux features, odl-mdsal-apidocs, odl-restconf, and odl-l2switch-switch installed. The Opendaylight can communicate with my other switches including an SBC running an Open vSwitch, a mininet, Zodiac FX SDN switches, and a Pica8 Switch, but strangely, not with the mentioned HP SDN switch.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to try the HP switch with Opendaylight Hydrogen (the first one), and it worked just fine (though it forced the controller to communicate with OpenFlow 1.0). But I seemed can't make it work with Opendaylight version other than hydrogen (I tried with Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen).</p>\n\n<p>How can I connect that switch, is there anything that I should do before I enable Openflow? Any hints or helps will be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>Here is the TCP dump of my controller</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\r\n05:40:22.762385 IP 10.10.5.91.61524 &gt;
