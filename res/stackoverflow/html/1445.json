My problem is the site I'm working on as over 9000 products some with measurements within their title so they'll use doubles i.e.\n<code>Product item A 1/2\"</code>. When using quotes in the CSV file it seems to return it as 2 double quotes which are making the comparing part a little tricky. How can I overcome this issue? </p>\n\n<p>HTML</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;div class=\"item-options\"&gt;\n             &lt;!--START: itemnamelink--&gt;&lt;a href=\"product.asp?itemid=[ITEM_CATALOGID]\"&gt;[ITEM_NAME]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--END: itemnamelink--&gt;\n             &lt;!--START: itemnamenolink--&gt;&lt;span id=\"Span1\"&gt;[ITEM_NAME]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--END: itemnamenolink--&gt;\n             &lt;!--START: itemoptions--&gt;\n             &lt;br /&gt;\n             &lt;a href=\"#\" onclick=\"toggleProdOptions('opt[ITEM_ID]')\"&gt;View/Hide options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n             &lt;div id=\"opt[ITEM_ID]\" name=\"opt[ITEM_ID]\" style=\"display:none;\"&gt;[OPTIONS]&lt;/div&gt;\n             &lt;!--END: itemoptions--&gt;\n             &lt;!--START: recurring_frequency--&gt;\n             &lt;br /&gt;\n             This item will Autoship every &lt;strong&gt;[recurring_frequency]&lt;/strong&gt;\n             &lt;!--END: recurring_frequency--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Javascript</p>\n\n<pre><code> $(document).ready(function() {\n\n  var itemToStore = document.getElementsByClassName(\"item-options\");\n\n  localStorage.setItem(\"itemToStore\", JSON.stringify(itemToStore));\n\n  var retrieved = localStorage.getItem(\"itemToStore\");\n\n\n\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; itemToStore .length; i++) {\n    var itemName= itemToStore [i].innerText;\n    var name = (\"\"+itemName).replace(/['\"]+/g,'');\n    console.log(\"Name: \" + name);\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n    $.ajax({\n      type: \"GET\",\n      url: \"assets/exports/pipe.csv\",\n      dataType:\"text\",\n\n\n        success: function(data) {\n\n\n\n        var code = name.split(\"\\n\");\n        for(var i=0;i&lt;code.length;i++){\n          code[i]=\"\\\"\"+code[i]+\"\\\"\";\n\n        }\n\n        var pipeString = code.join(\"\\n\");\n\nvar test = \"Pipe\";\nconsole.log(test);\n        // Flag that value found\n        var found = false;\n        // Remove \\n and split by ,\n        var listPipe = data.split('\\r\\n').map(function(row){\n          return row.split(',');\n        });\n\n        var pipeList = (\"\"+listPipe).replace(/['\"]+/g,'');\n\n        console.log(pipeList);\n\n        // Array of arrays like be generated\n                for (var i = 0; i &lt; listPipe.length; i++) {\n                    if ($.inArray(test, listPipe) !== -1) {\n                        found = true;\n                        console.log(\"found\");\n                    }\n\n                    else{\n                        console.log(\"not found\");\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n            });\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>CSV FILE\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hIUnt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hIUnt.png\" alt=\"csv file\"></a></p>\n\n<p>console.log results\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Em9Ak.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Em9Ak.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"
