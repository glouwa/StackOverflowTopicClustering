            "body": "<p>I'm trying to share an object between two components through a service.</p>\n\n<p>The component <code>option-post.component</code> is meant to display this object or an array of thoses objects. The  component <code>option-post-choix.component</code> is used to select wich objects you want <code>option-post.component</code> to display. I use <code>option-data.service</code> to share the data between both components. </p>\n\n<p>I can see with the <code>console.log('service recv', data)</code> in <code>option-data.service</code> that my data arrives to the service but in <code>option-post.component</code> i can see with <code>console.log('recv',this.option_select)</code> that i only receive an empty array.

I have a project where I would like to keep track of different IDs by counting their total occurrence.\r\n\r\nI have a topic on Message Hub that produces messages like\r\n`{&quot;ID&quot;:&quot;123&quot;,&quot;TIMESTAMP&quot;:&quot;1525339553&quot;, &quot;BALANCE&quot;:&quot;100&quot;, &quot;AMOUNT&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}`, for now, the only key of relevance is ID.\r\n\r\nMy Kafka code, along with the Streams configuration, looks like this:\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;\r\n\r\n    Properties props = new Properties();\r\n\tprops.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, appId);\r\n\tprops.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);\r\n\tprops.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());\r\n\tprops.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());\r\n\tprops.put(StreamsConfig.REPLICATION_FACTOR_CONFIG, &quot;3&quot;);\t\r\n\tprops.put(&quot;security.protocol&quot;,&quot;SASL_SSL&quot;);\r\n\tprops.put(&quot;sasl.mechanism&quot;,&quot;PLAIN&quot;);\r\n\tprops.put(&quot;ssl.protocol&quot;,&quot;TLSv1.2&quot;);\r\n\tprops.put(&quot;ssl.enabled.protocols&quot;,&quot;TLSv1.2&quot;);\r\n\tString saslJaasConfig = &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\\&quot;USERNAME\\&quot; password=\\&quot;PASSWORD\\&quot;;&quot;;\r\n\tsaslJaasConfig = saslJaasConfig.replace(&quot;USERNAME&quot;, user).replace(&quot;PASSWORD&quot;, password);\r\n\tprops.put(&quot;sasl.jaas.config&quot;,saslJaasConfig);\r\n\r\n    StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();\r\n\t\t\r\n    KStream&lt;String, String&gt; Kstreams = builder.stream(myTopic);\r\n\r\n\tKTable&lt;String, Long&gt; eventCount = Kstreams\r\n\t\t\t.flatMapValues(value -&gt; getID(value)) //function that retrieves the ID\r\n\t\t\t.groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)\r\n            .count();\r\n\r\nWhen I run the code, I get the following error(s):\r\n\r\n&gt;Exception in thread &quot;KTableTest-e2062d11-0b30-4ed0-82b0-00d83dcd9366-&gt;StreamThread-1&quot; org.apache.kafka.streams.errors.StreamsException: Could not create topic KTableTest-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-repartition.\r\n\r\nFollowed by:\r\n\r\n&gt;Caused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.PolicyViolationException: Invalid configuration: {segment.index.bytes=52428800, segment.bytes=52428800, cleanup.policy=delete, segment.ms=600000}. Only allowed configs: [retention.ms, cleanup.policy]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no idea why this error occurs, and what could be done about it. Is the way I have built the KStream and KTable incorrect somehow? Or perhaps the message hub on bluemix?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I would like some help with, is how I could monitor my KTable without having to write to a new topic? I would like to see if it does what I want it to do before I write to a topic. I have tried the following, but since the KTable is not running I cannot really know:\r\n\r\n    KStream&lt;String, Long&gt; KstreamsOut = eventCount.toStream();\r\n\t\t\t\t.mapValues(value -&gt; {System.out.println(value); return value;});\r\n\t\t\r\n\tKstreamsOut.foreach(new ForeachAction&lt;String, Long&gt;() {\r\n\t\t    public void apply(String key, Long value) {\r\n\t\t        System.out.println(key + &quot;: &quot; + value);\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t });\r\nBut as long I cannot get the KTable to work, it not relevant.",

            "title": "Kafka Streams KTable configuration error",
            "body": "<p>I am having some trouble creating a KTable in Kafka. I am new to Kafka, which is probably the root of my problem, but I thought I could ask here anyway. I have a project where I would like to keep track of different IDs by counting their total occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>I have a topic on Message Hub that produces messages like\n<code>{\"ID\":\"123\",\"TIMESTAMP\":\"1525339553\", \"BALANCE\":\"100\", \"AMOUNT\":\"4\"}</code>, for now, the only key of relevance is ID.</p>\n\n<p>My Kafka code, along with the Streams configuration, looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;\n\nProperties props = new Properties();\nprops.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, appId);\nprops.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);\nprops.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());\nprops.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());\nprops.put(StreamsConfig.REPLICATION_FACTOR_CONFIG, \"3\");    \nprops.put(\"security.protocol\",\"SASL_SSL\");\nprops.put(\"sasl.mechanism\",\"PLAIN\");\nprops.put(\"ssl.protocol\",\"TLSv1.2\");\nprops.put(\"ssl.enabled.protocols\",\"TLSv1.2\");\nString saslJaasConfig = \"org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\\\"USERNAME\\\" password=\\\"PASSWORD\\\";\";\nsaslJaasConfig = saslJaasConfig.replace(\"USERNAME\", user).replace(\"PASSWORD\", password);\nprops.put(\"sasl.jaas.config\",saslJaasConfig);\n\nStreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();\n\nKStream&lt;String, String&gt; Kstreams = builder.stream(myTopic);\n\nKTable&lt;String, Long&gt; eventCount = Kstreams\n        .flatMapValues(value -&gt; getID(value)) //function that retrieves the ID\n        .groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)\n        .count();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run the code, I get the following error(s):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exception in thread \"KTableTest-e2062d11-0b30-4ed0-82b0-00d83dcd9366->StreamThread-1\" org.apache.kafka.streams.errors.StreamsException: Could not create topic KTableTest-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-repartition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Followed by:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Caused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.PolicyViolationException: Invalid configuration: {segment.index.bytes=52428800, segment.bytes=52428800, cleanup.policy=delete, segment.ms=600000}. Only allowed configs: [retention.ms, cleanup.policy]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea why this error occurs, and what could be done about it. Is the way I have built the KStream and KTable incorrect somehow? Or perhaps the message hub on bluemix?</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I would like some help with, is how I could monitor my KTable without having to write to a new topic? I would like to see if it does what I want it to do before I write to a topic. I have tried the following, but since the KTable is not running I cannot really know:</p>\n\n<pre><code>KStream&lt;String, Long&gt; KstreamsOut = eventCount.toStream();\n            .mapValues(value -&gt; {System.out.println(value); return value;});\n\nKstreamsOut.foreach(new ForeachAction&lt;String, Long&gt;() {\n        public void apply(String key, Long value) {\n            System.out.println(key + \": \" + value);\n        }\n     });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But as long I cannot get the KTable to work, it not relevant.</p>\n"
