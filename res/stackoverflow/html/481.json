I got some problems using this way. Around 1% users complain that after a successful purchasing of a subscription these subscriptions do not work within the app. I asked the support of Google Pla for this problem. They recommended using a new Play Billing Library. I looked at the example in the instructions https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/play-billing-codelab/#6. However, this example does not consider checking the status of the subscription. \r\n\r\nAlso I found on the page https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_library.html following: &quot;The Google Play service returns the purchases made by the user account logged in to the device. If the request is successful, the Play Billing Library stores the query results in a List of Purchase objects. To retrieve the list, call the getPurchasesList() method on the PurchasesResult object.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo to BillingManager class from tutorial I added a code to check purchases for subscriptions:\r\n\r\n    public Purchase.PurchasesResult querySubscriptionPurchases() {\r\n            return mBillingClient.queryPurchases(BillingClient.SkuType.SUBS);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nUsing BillingManager in the MainActivity:\r\n\r\n    mBillingManager = new BillingManager(this);\r\n            Purchase.PurchasesResult purchasesResult = mBillingManager.querySubscriptionPurchases();\r\n            if (purchasesResult != null) {\r\n                List&lt;Purchase&gt; p = purchasesResult.getPurchasesList();\r\n            }\r\n\r\nWhen I run app, in the logcat I see &quot;I/BillingManager: onBillingSetupFinished() response: 0&quot;.

I can extract all those links using beautiful soup, but I am not able to delete the lineup links. I noticed all the lineup links start with &quot;statss.&quot; Is there any way to tell beautiful soup to decompose the &quot;statss&quot; links when extracting all the links on the page? My current code is displayed below. As you can tell, I have tried using the decompose function by attempting to find class=lineup, but the output still returns the entire lineup.

Clean-build it with dozens of exclusions and minor transitive dependencies\r\n   changes; \r\n\r\n - Invalidate cache / restart / clean local cache files; \r\n\r\n - `implementation` vs `api` vs `compile`;\r\n\r\n - Multidex for tiny lib?:) Tried just to be sure, all the same;\r\n\r\n - Downgrade build version from 3.1 to 3.0 (D8 vs DX compiler): in that case i received `UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define` even with all dependencies except vital Kotlin removed;\r\n\r\n - See one more below:\r\n\r\nActually I&#39;m 90% sure that&#39;s about Kotlin as its components are widely used in both modules and it&#39;s the last thing I cannot \r\nafford myself to be without, therefore I tried to exclude everything from samples module except Kotlin std&#39;s. \r\nSo I also tried this &quot;dirty trick&quot;: \r\n\r\n\ttasks.whenTaskAdded {task -&gt;\r\n\t\tif(task.name.contains(&quot;transformDexArchiveWithDexMergerForDebug&quot;)) {\r\n\t\t\ttask.enabled = false\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAnd yep, with that build actually finishes, but then I face another problem each time trying to run it on Xiaomi Redmi 4X: \r\n\t\r\n\tInstallation failed with message Failed to finalize session : INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK: \r\n\tPackage couldn&#39;t be installed in /data/app/com.kkaun.tinyarbrowser-1: Package /data/app/com.kkaun.tinyarbrowser-1/base.apk code is missing.\r\n\tIt is possible that this issue is resolved by uninstalling an existing version of the apk if it is present, and then re-installing.\r\n\t\r\nAs for this issue, I tried to disable/re-enable Instant Run, turn off MIUI-specific dev features, reboot etc. - it&#39;s still the same.\r\n\r\nOut of options, for real. However, changing project structure for single lib module to be functioning is not an option at the moment. \r\n\r\nAny constructive thoughts will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nEDIT :\r\n------\r\n\r\nFull stack trace of the key issue provided below:\r\n\r\n\t&gt; Task :samples:transformDexArchiveWithDexMergerForDebug FAILED\r\n\r\n\tFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n\t* What went wrong:\r\n\tExecution failed for task &#39;:samples:transformDexArchiveWithDexMergerForDebug&#39;.\r\n\t&gt; com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException: com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveMergerException: Error while merging dex archives: D:\\AndroidStudioPr\r\n\tojects\\TinyARBrowser\\samples\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\dexBuilder\\debug\\17, D:\\AndroidStudioProjects\\TinyARBrowser\\samples\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\dexBuilder\\debug\\18, D:\\AndroidStudioProjects\\TinyARBrows\r\n\ter\\samples\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\externalLibsDexMerger\\debug\\0, D:\\AndroidStudioProjects\\TinyARBrowser\\samples\\build\\intermediates\\transforms\\dexBuilder\\debug\\16.jar\r\n\r\n\t* Try:\r\n\tRun with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
