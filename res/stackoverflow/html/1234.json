Is there a way to create a wrapper file that returns the existing JQuery in the expected format?\r\n\r\n**I think the wrapper needs to be in AMD format ...** \r\n\r\n\r\npackage.json

Both logs where created after uploading the mappings file. Logs of older versions with no mappings file show an explicit &quot;logs are obfuscated&quot; message\r\n - What is the meaning of the `OR` statements within the call stack? Does this mean, that the exception happened in each of these methods (how should this be possible)?\r\n - Why are there no line numbers in the de-obfuscated logs? The given methods are quite long and without any further information I have no idea what exactly might have caused the problem. The line numbers in the obfuscated seem to point to random lines which are not linked to the real code in any way.\r\n\r\n**So the main question is:**\r\n\r\n**How to use the information from the logs to find the source of the crash?**",

I would like to be able to set the layout on the host component so the component will try taking it from the host component.</p>\n\n<p>So instead of repeating layout like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class='input-group'&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" label=\"Name\" [layout] =\"{'col_label':2, 'col_input':3,'col_validation':2}\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"text\" id=\"address\" label=\"address\" [layout] =\"{'col_label':2, 'col_input':3,'col_validation':2}\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"number\" id=\"zip\" label=\"zip\" [layout] =\"{'col_label':2, 'col_input':3,'col_validation':2}\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will have properties on my Form’s component</p>\n\n<pre><code>export class UserFormComponent {\n    col_label=2;\n    col_input=3;\n    col_validation'=2;\n.\n.\n.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And on the component I can query the host for the values (if exists). something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.\n.\nthis._gridLabelColumn = parent.col_label;\nthis._gridInputColumn = parent.col_input;\n.\n.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will make the html much shorter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class='input-group'&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" label=\"Name\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"text\" id=\"address\" label=\"address\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n    &lt;my-input type=\"number\" id=\"zip\" label=\"zip\"&gt;&lt;/my-input&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please note that components can be hosted in many forms/components, so I really don't know what is the host type.</p>\n"
