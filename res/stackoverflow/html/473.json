            "body": "<p>I can configure Kong's <a href=\"https://getkong.org/plugins/rate-limiting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rate limiting plugin</a> so it enforces limits on each endpoint in a given API like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \\\n    --data \"name=rate-limiting\" \\\n    --data \"config.second=5\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I'd like to configure different rate limits <em>per endpoint</em>. For example, I'd like to allow:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>http://localhost:8000/endpoint1</code> to use a rate limit of 5 requests/second per IP</li>\n<li><code>http://localhost:8000/endpoint2</code> to use a rate limit of 10 requests/second per IP</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is this possible with Kong? I see an <a href=\"https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/505\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">open issue</a> related to this, but are there any workarounds?</p>\n"
