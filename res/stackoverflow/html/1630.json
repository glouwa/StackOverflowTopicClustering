            "body_markdown": "Let&#39;s assume I have the following classes in my project:\r\n\r\n 1. Base interface\r\n\r\n        public interface IInvoker\r\n        {\r\n            void Invoke();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n 2. Two classes implementing the interface\r\n\r\n    The first one:\r\n\r\n        public class Invoker1 : IInvoker\r\n        {\r\n            public void Invoke()\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Invoker #1&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    And the second:\r\n\r\n        public class Invoker2 : IInvoker\r\n        {\r\n            public void Invoke()\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Invoker #2&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n 3. Additionally I have a class which has a field of the interface type:\r\n\r\n        public class InvokerContainer\r\n        {\r\n            private readonly IInvoker target;\r\n\r\n            public InvokerContainer(IInvoker invoker)\r\n            {\r\n                this.target = invoker;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public void InvokeTarget()\r\n            {\r\n                this.target.Invoke();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe client code looks as follows:\r\n\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            InvokingMethod1(new Invoker1());\r\n            InvokingMethod2(new Invoker2());\r\n            new InvokerContainer(new Invoker1()).InvokeTarget();\r\n            Console.ReadKey();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static void InvokingMethod1(IInvoker invoker)\r\n        {\r\n            invoker.Invoke();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static void InvokingMethod2(IInvoker invoker)\r\n        {\r\n            invoker.Invoke();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Is there any way to find all places where `Invoker1#Invoke` is used and what is a possible invocation hierarchy?\r\nWith the code above, this approach should give the following results:\r\n\r\n 1. Calling method: `Program#InvokingMethod1`. The stacktrace: `Program#Main`-&gt;`Program#InvokingMethod1` line 17\r\n 2. Calling method: `InvokerContainer#InvokeTarget`. The stacktrace: `Program#Main`-&gt;`InvokerContainer#InvokeTarget` line 14\r\n",

The symptom is that it becomes slower and slower as time goes by. \r\n\r\nWhen I start the process, it handles n pages/s. After a a few hours, the speed goes down to around n/2 pages/s. It can go down to n/10 after a few days. The phenomenon has been observed many times and is rather deterministic. Anytime the process is restarted things are back to normal.\r\n\r\nVery importantly: I can run other calculations in the same process and they are not slowed down: I can reach 100% CPU with anything I want at any time. The process itself is not slow.
